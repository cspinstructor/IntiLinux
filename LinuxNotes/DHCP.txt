DHCP
====

Objective
---------
To set up a DHCP Server to assign dynamic IP's to win98/ME and
Linux hosts within the LAN.  DHCP stands for Dynamic Host 
Configuration Protocol.

The setup is shown in Fig A below:


   LAN with                 Firewall   
   net address  -----(eth0)    +    (eth1)---- Internet
   192.168.0.0/24          DHCP Server

	Fig A. DHCP Server for a LAN
	----------------------------

where eth0 is the internal interface, and eth1 (or ppp0) 
is the external interface, which may be ADSL, ISDN or analog
modem.
 
The LAN consists of Win98/ME and  hosts and the Firewall runs
Linux.        		 


Warning
-------
Running a DHCP server, dhcpd, on the firewall machine is 
dangerous. If network neighbours on the ISP's subnet
are DHCP clients, they can confuse the Firewall dhcp server
with the ISP's DHCP server. Jaring or TMnet may terminate
your ISP account. Ideally we should run a DHCP server inside
the LAN, behind the firewall.


However, assuming we choose the topology as in Fig A, then
the firewall rule must ensure that local messages are allowed
to pass through only the internal network interface to the 
LAN. The firewall rules must ensure that the DHCP messages 
from the LAN are are not forwarded through the external
network interface. An easy way out of this is to simply
edit the /etc/rc.d/init.d/dhcpd script as described below.
No need to edit the rc.firewall script.


Configuring the dhcpd server
----------------------------

Two steps are needed to avoid the problems mentioned above:

[1]  The specific network interface must be defined for dhcpd
before the dhcpd server is started.  To assign the dhcpd server
to a particular interface (ie the internal interface), edit
the dhcpd startup script:

	/etc/rc.d/init.d/dhcpd

by editing this line as follows:

	daemon /usr/sbin/dhcpd eth0

where eth0 is the internal interface.


[2]  Add the following line to /etc/rc.d/rc.local:

	route add -host 255.255.255.255 dev eth0

where eth0 is the internal interface.  This is to direct all
broadcasts to the internal network rather than go out to the
Internet.


The terse explanation can also be found in the manuals
dhcpd.conf and dhcpd.leases.



Configuring the range of IP addresses
-------------------------------------
The dhcpd server configuration file is /etc/dhcpd.conf. The
file must contain a declaration record for each subnet attached
to the server machine. Assuming only one subnet as in Fig. A,
set the configuration as follows:


option domain-name "society.intipen.edu.my";
option domain-name-servers 192.168.0.1;
option subnet-mask 255.255.255.0;
subnet 192.168.0.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
	range 192.168.0.10 192.168.0.100;
	default-lease-time 86400;
	max-lease-time 2592000;
	option broadcast-address 192.168.0.255;
	option routers 192.168.0.1;
}




Lines 1 to 3 are self-explanatory.

Line 4 specifies that the dhcpd server will assign IP addresses
for the network 192.168.0.0/24.

Line 5 specifies the range of IP address to be used during
assignment. Note that you should not start from 192.168.0.1 because
it is reserved for the server. In this setting, the first IP
address to be assign is 192.168.0.10 and the last is 192.168.0.100.

Line 6 specifies that the dynamic IP that is assigned will last only
for 1 day (86400 seconds), ie, for those client who do not specify
an expiration time.

Line 7 specifies that the maximum allowed for any IP that is assigned
is 1 month (2592000 seconds) - ie for those clients who do specify
for an expiration time.

Line 8 specifies the LAN's broadcast address
 
Line 9 speficies the default gateway (router)



The dhcpd.leases file
---------------------
The dhcpd.leases file must be created before the dhcpd server
will start. The purpose of this file is to keep track of which
host has requested for IP addresses and also the expiry period
for each IP assigned (the lease).

To create the dhcpd.leases file:

	touch /var/lib/dhcp/dhcpd.leases


# The format of this file is documented in the 
# dhcpd.leases(5) manual page.

lease 192.168.0.10 {
	starts 6 2002/10/19 14:13:25;
	ends 0 2002/10/20 14:13:25;
	hardware ethernet 00:08:a1:19:90:4a;
	uid 01:00:08:a1:19:90:4a;
	client-hostname "Annie";
}
lease 192.168.0.11 {
	starts 1 2002/10/21 06:54:53;
	ends 2 2002/10/22 06:54:53;
	hardware ethernet 00:e0:98:99:7a:b0;
	uid 01:00:e0:98:99:7a:b0;
}


After creating the dhcpd.lease file, do not edit it.
It is meant for the dhcpd server to keep track of what IP
has been assigned and the expiry period for each IP.


Win98/ME client configuration
-----------------------------
Right-click on Network Neighborhood, or, My Network Places on the
Desktop.  On the pop up menu, select  properties. In the Network 
dialog box, select TCP/IP's properties. Then, set as follows:

[IP Address]
Obtain an IP address automatically

[Gateway]
192.168.0.1

[DNS Configuration]
192.168.0.1

The above settings assume that your firewall/router/gateway 
is 192.168.0.1 and your internal caching nameserver is also 192.168.0.1.



Linux client configuration
--------------------------
Add the default gateway to:

	/etc/sysconfig/network

by adding this line

	GATEWAY="192.168.0.1"

or edit:

	/etc/rc.d/rc.local

by adding this line;

	route add default gw 192.168.0.1

Then run the dhcp client program:

	dhcpcd eth0

and the Linux host will ask the DHCP server for an IP address.
eth0 is the interface where the dynamically assigned IP will be
bound to. 

Note the spelling:

	dhcpcd  NOT   dhcpd

dhcpd is the DHCP server,
dhcpcd is the DHCP client.

To release the dhcp-assigned address:

	dhcpcd -k

Firewall configuration
----------------------
The rc.firewall should be edited to filter MAC addresses.

If you need to filter based on both IP and MAC, then, you should
edit the file /etc/dhcpd.conf file as described below.


Fixed IP configuration
----------------------
So that a predetermined IP will be assigned to a particular 
MAC address, edit the /etc/dhcpd.conf as follows:


option domain-name "society.intipen.edu.my";
option domain-name-servers 192.168.0.1;
option subnet-mask 255.255.255.0;
option broadcast-address 192.168.0.255;
option routers 192.168.0.1;

subnet 192.168.0.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
	range 192.168.0.10 192.168.0.100;
}
host Annie
{
	hardware ethernet 00:08:a1:19:90:4a;
	fixed-address 192.168.0.15;
}

host Unix
{
	hardware ethernet 00:e0:98:99:7a:b0;
	fixed-address 192.168.0.25;
}



Remember to restart dhcpd after modifying the dhcpd.conf file:

	/etc/rc.d/init.d/dhcpd restart



When not to use dynamic IP's
-----------------------------
Do not use dynamic IP's for servers, eg, file/print servers,
database servers, email servers, routers, gateways. 


For, example if need to share some MS-Excel files on one of the
hosts within the LAN, then this host should have a fixed IP.
