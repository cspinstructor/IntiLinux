SECURITY 2 - Overview of General Concepts
-----------------------------------------

Objective
---------
To give a general  overview of some Security concepts


Intro
-----
Security is too wide a topic to fit into just one short
chapter, as such this Chapter will only briefly skim through
some general concepts.

Passive attacks vs Active attacks 
---------------------------------
"Passive attacks" refer to sniffing or mining for information
that could be used in an active attack.  It includes using
sniffers (protocol analyzers), traffic analysis, social
engineering, keyloggers, remote desktop capture, DNS queries,
mapping network and domain architecture and trust relationships.


"Active attacks" are those in which the attacker actively
tries to gain unauthorized access to a network or system, or, 
deliberately causes the system to become incaccessible (Denial of
Service).


Physical Security 
-----------------
Refers to the physical location of computer equipment, eg, 
access to server room, exposure of network cables, power supply,
switches, routers.

System Security
---------------
Security of the Operating System, or, server programs. Usually
software bugs are exploited to cause O.S. or server programs to
execute unauthorised commands. 


Network Security
----------------
Security of the network devices, eg, routers, firewall, gateways.


Penetration attacks vs Denial of Service attacks
------------------------------------------------
Penetration attacks - where attacker's goal is to get access to the
system, eg, spoofing based attacks, buffer overflow attacks.

Denial of Service attacks - where attacker's goal is to cause services
to be delayed or become inaccessible, eg, malicious code, virus,
email flooding, worms. 


Security Policy
---------------
A list of what users are allowed to do or not allowed to do, which
machine is allowed to access services, what services are allowed to
users/machines.  What to do in the event of a compromise.

Whether or not a system has been compromised depends on the security
policy.


Security Mechanisms
-------------------
Authentication, encryption, packet filtering(firewalls), content
filtering (proxy servers).


Factors contributing to increase in security incidents
------------------------------------------------------
1. Automation and speed of attack tools.
2. Increased sophistication of attack tools.
3. Faster discovery of vulnerabilities.
4. Lack of duty of care in ensuring secure systems/networks.
5. Growth of the Internet.
