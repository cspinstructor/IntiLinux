ANSWERING MACHINE
=================

Objective
---------
Using Linux as answering machine.


Config file
-----------

/etc/mgetty+sendfax/voice.conf

Set voice_devices ttyS1
Set port ttyS1



Voice directories
-----------------

/var/spool/voice/incoming/
/var/spool/voice/messages/


Greeting message is standard.rmd
Plug mic into modem and record greeting with this command:

	vm record -m /var/spool/voice/messages/standard.rmd




Start Answering Machine
-----------------------

Command:

	vgetty -n 3 /dev/ttyS1

where 3 is answer after 3 rings and ttyS1 is the modem


When someone calls, the modem answers after the 3rd ring and plays
the greeting, then records the message of the caller.


To playback, goto /var/spool/voice/incoming/ directory and play the
*.rmd file as follows:


rmdtopvf v-26622-1041690637.rmd | pvfspeed -s 8000 | pvftobasic > /dev/audio


where v-26622-1041690637.rmd is the recorded caller's message.

To playback on modem speaker:

	vm play -s  v-26622-1041690637.rmd 



Using /etc/inittab
------------------

The above is the lazy way to start the answering machine, ie, via the
command line. The log files /etc/log/vgetty.log.ttyS1 will show an error.
The proper way is:

[ from http://linuxindia.virtualave.net/lamhowto.html ]

"Replace the invocation of mgetty in your /etc/inittab with
vgetty if there is one. If there is no mgetty invocation you just have
to insert a lne like:

S1:345:respawn:/sbin/vgetty ttyS1

in your  /etc/inittab file."

Then reboot.
