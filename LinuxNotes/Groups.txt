GROUPS
=======


Objective
---------
Creating and adding groups.


Creating Group
--------------
groupadd project


Adding members
--------------
To add bill to project group, first find out what groups
he belong to:

	groups bill

	bill:  bill
or,

	id bill
	
Then, 
	usermod -G bill,project bill

If you did this:

	usermod -G project bill

bill will lose membership to his own default group bill!
That is why you need to do:

	groups bill 

first.



If you accidentally removed bill from his group ( ie bill),
the scripts in his /home/bill/public_html/cgi-bin
will break:

	cannot execute script, <scriptname> does not have same ID
	

If you did a mistake and want to restore bill to his default
group:

	usermod -g bill bill

The syntax:

	usermod -g <group> bill




Setting permission on group files
---------------------------------
Allow only members of project group to read file, eg:

	chmod 660 projectfile.txt





Only root
---------
All the steps above can only be done by root.




How to change group
-------------------
After root has setup the groups as above, bill may 
change group as follows:

	newgrp project

He can then create files all of which will have the
following ownership:

	bill.project    file.txt

To revert back to his original group:

	newgrp bill

or, better still:

	exit

The newgrp command will create subshells
