Internet Gateway
================

Objective
---------

This chapter will explain how to set up Internet Connection Sharing,
so that all the PC's in the LAN can share one internet connection.


Network Topology
----------------
The target topology is as shown in Fig A.  below:



          Internet <---> Modem <---> Firewall <----> Hub <-----> LAN

		      
	Fig. A  Internet Connection Sharing Architecture


Note that the Linux Firewall is also the Internet Gateway.
The Firewall runs on the Linux Server.  Only firewall services and
possibly sshd is enabled while all other services are disabled.  
The firewall acts as an Internet Connection Sharing Device, using IP
masquerading. It uses NAT, which stands for Network Address Translation.
All PC's within the LAN will have intranet addresses, eg, Fig B below:

	         
	              		             192.168.0.2	
     Internet  <--->    Firewall    <--->    192.168.0.3
	              161.142.118.8	     192.168.0.4

	Fig B.  Network Address Translation	


In the above diagram, 192.168.0.2 192.168.0.3 and 192.168.0.4 are all
intranet addresses.  Intranet addresses are reserved for Local Area
Networks.  No routers on the Internet will route these addresses.	
If any of the hosts within the LAN requests for a connection to an 
Internet address, its IP will be substituted with the IP of the Firewall.
The Firewall will send the packet to the Internet.  When the reply comes 
back, the firewall will subsitute the internal host's IP again and 
forward the packet to it.	




Iptables
--------
Iptables is the Firewall aministration program used in Linux.
It is also used to enable internet connection sharing. A simple
script called "firewall.sh" to enable internet connection sharing is
shown below:

#!/bin/sh
# firewall.sh
# Lean and Mean MAC/IP - based Firewall Gateway
# by Paul Chin  Aug 12, 2002
# modified Sept 1, 2002 - can run without init.d/firewall.2-4
# just do /etc/rc.d/firewall.sh
# to stop, just flush the rulesets: iptables -F

echo -e "\n\nLoading Lean and Mean MAC/IP based Firewall Gateway..\n"

IPTABLES=/sbin/iptables

#Setting the EXTERNAL and INTERNAL interfaces for the network
EXTIF="ppp0"  # Use eth1 for ADSL dial-up, if ADSL static use eth1
INTIF="eth0"

echo "   External Interface:  $EXTIF"
echo "   Internal Interface:  $INTIF"


echo -en "   loading modules: "

# Need to verify that all modules have all required dependencies
echo "  - Verifying that all kernel modules are ok"
/sbin/depmod -a


#Load the main body of the IPTABLES module - "iptable"
echo -en "ip_tables, "
/sbin/insmod ip_tables


#Load the stateful connection tracking framework - "ip_conntrack"
echo -en "ip_conntrack, "
/sbin/insmod ip_conntrack


#Load the FTP tracking mechanism for full FTP tracking
echo -en "ip_conntrack_ftp, "
/sbin/insmod ip_conntrack_ftp


#Load the IRC tracking mechanism for full IRC tracking
echo -en "ip_conntrack_irc, "
/sbin/insmod ip_conntrack_irc


#Load the general IPTABLES NAT code - "iptable_nat"
echo -en "iptable_nat, "
/sbin/insmod iptable_nat


#Loads the FTP NAT functionality into the core IPTABLES code
# Required to support non-PASV FTP.
echo -en "ip_nat_ftp, "
/sbin/insmod ip_nat_ftp

echo ".  Done loading modules."


# Enable IP forwarding since it is disabled by default since
echo "   enabling forwarding.."
echo "1" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward


# Dynamic IP users:
echo "   enabling DynamicAddr.."
echo "1" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_dynaddr


# Default Policies
echo "   clearing any existing rules and setting default policy.."
$IPTABLES -P INPUT ACCEPT 
$IPTABLES -F INPUT 
$IPTABLES -P OUTPUT ACCEPT
					3
$IPTABLES -F OUTPUT 
$IPTABLES -P FORWARD DROP 
$IPTABLES -F FORWARD 
$IPTABLES -t nat -F


###################################################
# Forwarding Rules

# Note: Logging must precede Accept/Forwarding
$IPTABLES -A FORWARD -j LOG \
          --log-prefix "Firewall Forwarding: "

$IPTABLES -A FORWARD -i $EXTIF -o $INTIF -j ACCEPT #Allow all inbound

# List of hosts allowed to access the Internet
# identified by MAC and IP address
$IPTABLES -A FORWARD -i $INTIF -o $EXTIF \
-s 192.168.0.11 -m mac --mac-source 00:00:E8:E3:B1:5C -j ACCEPT
$IPTABLES -A FORWARD -i $INTIF -o $EXTIF \
-s 192.168.0.1 -m mac --mac-source 00:00:E8:E3:B1:5C -j ACCEPT




echo "   Enabling SNAT (MASQUERADE) functionality on $EXTIF"
$IPTABLES -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o $EXTIF -j MASQUERADE



echo -e "\nDone.\n"

 
The above script should be put in /etc/rc.d

To run the script call it directly as follows:


/etc/rc.d/firewall.sh



To stop the firewall:

$iptables -F

ie, flush all rulesets.

Notice also, that logging should precede accepting and forwarding.
If the reverse is done, no logging occurs.

In the "firewall.sh" script above, the firewall is designed to 
allow only certain IP's and MAC addresses to access the Internet.
This is to prevent unauthorised users within the LAN from accessing
the Internet. If the firewall only controls access based solely on 
IP address, this can easily be spoofed. Therefore the MAC address is 
also checked to ensure that only specific IP and MAC address combinations  
are allowed.  If any LAN users wish to access the Internet, they will 
need to see the System Administrator to register their MAC and IP address 
with the firewall.

Note however that this isn't 100% foolproof since MAC addresses can 
also be spoofed as follows:

	ifconfig eth0 hw ether <MAC>

where <MAC> is the 6 byte address of the NIC in hexadecimals.
See the chapter on Networking.

We can only hope to make it more difficult to gain unauthorised
access, not completely eliminate it.



Configuring Clients
-------------------
Assuming that the Gateway's Internal Interface has the IP address:
192.168.0.1.

For win98/ME, just set the default gateway in the TCP/IP Properties
to 192.168.0.1

For Linux, edit the /etc/sysconfig/network file by adding:

	GATEWAY="192.168.0.1"

Or edit the file /etc/rc.d/rc.local file by adding:

	route add default gw 192.168.0.1



Warning
-------
If you are using the Firewall with a Dynamic IP address ADSL, then
the EXTIF must be set to ppp0, because ppp0 is dynamically 
assigned.  Do not set EXTIF to eth1 because eth1 does not have
an IP address although it is up.

For Static IP address ADSL, set the eth1 to the IP address assigned
by TmNet.
