WGET
====

Objective
---------
Automating mirroring of web-sites and 
downloading of specific filetypes.


Program
-------
wget

It runs non-interactively and hence excellent for
scripting and automation.


Usage
-----

To mirror a web-site:


#!/bin/sh

WEBSITE=192.168.20.3/~paul/
wget --mirror --convert-links --html-extension $WEBSITE


Put the above script in crontab and leave it to
auto-update daily.

Your server will then become a mirror of the target $WEBSITE.

The --convert-links option means to convert all the cgi, asp,
php file extensions into .html extensions.


Downloading only jpg files
--------------------------

#!/bin/sh

WEBSITE=www.thestar.com.my
wget -r -l2 --no-parent -A.jpg  $WEBSITE


r = recursive
l2 = levels 2, ie, download 2 levels deep
no-parent means do not download the parent html file
