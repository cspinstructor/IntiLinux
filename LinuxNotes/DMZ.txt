DMZ 
====

Objective
---------
To set up a firewall with three interfaces that links 3 
networks as shown in Fig A below:

			Internet
			   |
			   |
	 Office		   |	          Labs
	192.168.0.x --- Firewall ----- 192.168.1.x	

	   Fig A - Firewall linking 3 networks
	   -----------------------------------

where the "Office" is the trusted network with network
address 192.168.0.0 and the "Labs" are the untrusted
network, also known as the DeMilitarized Zone (DMZ).

Note that in Fig A, the Firewall is also a router and 
Internet Gateway and may also serve MySQL and act as 
Intranet Web Server.

Internet
--------
Is connected to the Firewall's through the ISDN Terminal
Adapter.  It could very well be an analog modem, or, even
an ADSL modem.

The Firewall's interface is known as ppp0 and it's IP address
is dynamically assigned during dial-up.


Office
------
The connected to the Firewall through a switch or hub.  Its
NIC is called eth0, and should have the IP address 192.168.0.1
whilst all the hosts within the Office will have IP addresses from
192.168.0.2 to 192.168.0.254. Each hosts within the Office
should set its default gateway and primary nameserver to 192.168.0.1.


Labs
----
This is the DMZ and it is also connected to the Firewall through
a switch or hub.  Its NIC is called eth1, and should have the IP address
192.168.1.1 whilst all the hosts within the Labs will have IP addresses
from 192.168.1.2 to 192.168.1.254.  Each host within the Office
should set its default gateway and primary nameserver to 192.168.1.1.



Firewall Script

The firewall script is shown below:

 Note that the DMZ is the untrusted network and both the
DMZ and the Office network accesses the internet. But because
the DMZ and the Office uses different network addresses, they
need the router to forward the packets from one network to 
the other. Note that if an intruder in the DMZ deliberately
changes his IP to the same network as the Office, still he
can't access the Office because a router cannot forward 
packets from a host to another host where both are in the
same network (ie having the same network address).
