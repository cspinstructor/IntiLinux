DNS
===

Objective
---------
[1] To set up a purely resolving DNS caching server for 
    caching names only.

[2] To setup a DNS Server with authoritative resource records
    for a zone called society.intipen.edu.my



[1] Purely Caching Nameserver
=============================

Hosts file
----------
The alternative to DNS is 

	/etc/hosts

Whenever a client program wishes to connect. Given a 
hostname, it will consult this file to file the IP address.
Alternative we can use the Domain Name System, fondly
abbreviated as DNS. An example entry is:

	127.0.0.1   localhost
	192.168.0.1 Farscape
	192.168.0.2 Stargate


For a small network this may suffice, since it is quite
possible to duplicate the same file in all the hosts within
the LAN, but for a big network, it becomes tedious to maintain
all the "/etc/hosts" file for each and every host. A better 
method then is to set all host to consult a DNS server.



DNS
---
Machines on the internet understands IP addresses, not
names. Names are for human convenience. In order to connect
to a webserver, eg, the Web browser needs to resolve the
name, ie, convert the domain name into IP address. It does
this by consulting the "/etc/hosts" file described above, or,
connecting to a DNS server to request for the 
translation.  If the DNS server does not know it, it will
ask other DNS servers until an answer is obtained. Once
an answer is obtained, the DNS server will send it to
the web browser who will then connect to the IP address.
Fig. A below shows such a system.

              1                       2
 	  www.xyz.com		  www.xyz.com
   Web   ----------->     DNS     ---------->    DNS 
 Browser      4          Server       3         Server  
    |    202.34.56.2       A     202.34.56.2      B
    |    <----------             <-----------
    |5
    |
    |    202.34.56.2
    |-------------------> Internet


         Fig. A.  DNS servers resolving a name 



[1] Web Browser asks DNS server A "What's the IP address of
    www.xyz.com?".

[2] DNS Server A says "I don't know but i'll check with DNS
    Server B"

[3] DNS Server B says to A "It's 202.34.56.2"

[4] DNS Server A then tells Web browser "It's 202.34.56.2"

[5] Web Browser then connects to 202.34.56.2



The package name is BIND and the DNS server is called "named"
which stands for "name daemon".

Edit file

	/etc/resolv.conf

by adding

	search Farscape
	nameserver 127.0.0.1
	nameserver 202.123.445.56

where search is a keyword and Farscape is the name of the
host where named runs. This is followed by a list of
nameservers starting with 127.0.0.1 which is a must. Do not
change this.  The directive "nameserver" is a keyword.
Comments begin with a semicolon ";".

Edit 

	/etc/nsswitch.conf

by making sure this line is present;

	hosts:  files dns	

This tells the OS to search 

	/etc/hosts 

first to resolve the hostnames. If cannot resolve then only
use the namserver.


Edit

	/etc/host.conf

as follows:
	
	order hosts,bind
	multi on

It means search /etc/hosts first then nameserver.
The second line "multi on" means that a hostname can 
have multiple entries, ie, more than one IP address.
Also known as multi-homed.



To start or stop the nameserver just do:

	/etc/rc.d/init.d/named start|stop


DNS clients configuration
--------------------------
All the hosts within the LAN who needs to resolve
names must be set to consult the DNS server, Farscape,
in this case. For each host, add the following lines
in the "/etc/resolv.conf" file:

	search Farscape
	nameserver 192.168.0.1

and add this in the file "/etc/hosts" file:

	192.168.0.1  Farscape 





[2] Setting up a Domain
=======================

Choosing a Domain Name
----------------------

If your network has been registered as:

	society.intipen.edu.my

then you should NOT set your domain as:

	intipen.edu.my

because any search for www.intipen.edu.my, or,
mail.intipen.edu.my, or, ns.intipen.edu.my, will NOT
go out to your ISP's nameservers. The resolver
will search based on the:
	
	/etc/resolv.conf

file, eg:

	search intipen.edu.my	
	nameserver 127.0.0.1
	nameserver 202.188.0.133
	nameserver 202.188.1.5

For a request for www.intipen.edu.my, it will search 
nameserver 127.0.0.1, ie the LAN's host where nameserver 
runs. It will not search the second or third nameserver.
Another wrong setting is to set your domain as: 

	edu.my

and the /etc/resolv.conf as:

	search edu.my
	nameserver 127.0.0.1
	nameserver 202.188.0.133
	nameserver 202.188.1.5

If you set as above, then, whenever any of your clients
within the LAN requests for any name that ends with 
".edu.my", eg, www.intipen.edu.my, or, www.uum.edu.my, it
will search 127.0.0.1 and will never go out to the Internet
to search. The result is that none of your hosts within your 
LAN can ever surf an websites that end with ".edu.my"!


Therefore, if your domain is registered as:

	society.intipen.edu.my

the correct setting should be:

	search society.intipen.edu.my	
	nameserver 127.0.0.1
	nameserver 202.188.0.133
	nameserver 202.188.1.5



Name Server Initialization
--------------------------
The configuration file is:

	/etc/named.conf


set as follows:

--------------------------------------------------	
// Configuration for zone society.intipen.edu.my 

options {
	directory "/var/named";
};

zone "." {
	type hint;
	file "named.ca";
};


zone "0.0.127.in-addr.arpa" {
	type master;
	notify no;
	file "named.local";
};


zone "society.intipen.edu.my" {
	type master;
	notify no;
	file "society.intipen.edu.my";
};

zone "0.168.192.in-addr.arpa" {
	type master;
	notify no;
	file "192.168.0";
};
--------------------------------------------------------


Note that named.conf controls the initialization of named,
the nameserver. 

The only lines you may need to change are:

---------------------------------------------------
zone "society.intipen.edu.my" {
	type master;
	notify no;
	file "society.intipen.edu.my";
};

zone "0.168.192.in-addr.arpa" {
	type master;
	notify no;
	file "192.168.0";
};
----------------------------------------------------


Change 

	zone "society.intipen.edu.my" 
	...
	file "society.intipen.edu.my";

to your own zone. Note that the file

	"society.intipen.edu.my"

should be in

	/var/named/

the root directory for all zone records as specified by
the options directive:

	options {
		directory "/var/named";
	};

Later we will see what to put in the file. Basically it
should contain all forward mappings, ie, name --> IP
resolutions.

Coming back to the /etc/named.conf, change these lines


	zone "0.168.192.in-addr.arpa" 
	...
	file "192.168.0";

to suit your LAN.

Notice the IP address is reversed in the "zone" directive.
In this case, our LAN is 192.168.0.x, as such this file should
be named  "192.168.0".  It will also be in this directory:

	/var/named



Zone records
------------
According to /etc/named.conf, there should be 
four zone records in the directory "/var/named/" :

	named.ca
	society.intipen.edu.my
	192.168.0
	named.local

There should be one more:

	localhost.zone

So, altogether 5 zone records.	Do not edit the
	
	named.ca
	localhost.zone

zone records. The "named.ca" file lists all the root servers in 
the world. Whenever, a nameserver cannot resolve a name, it consults
the root servers either recursively or interactively. Recursive
is when the ISP's nameserver recursively asks each name server
in turn up its domain tree, all the way back up to the root.
Interactive, is when the nameserver returns the address of 
the next higher up nameserver to the client's resolver and it is
up to the resolver of the client machine to follow up.

All the other three zone records that should be edited are:

	society.intipen.edu.my
	192.168.0
	named.local

Their contents would now be described below.

Note this line:
	
@	IN SOA society.intipen.edu.my. paul.intipen.edu.my.(

paul.intipen.edu.my. is not read by named, it is the email of
the administrator:

	paul@intipen.edu.my

Notice that there is a "." at the end of each name, ie, the
full-path name all the way to the root of the DNS tree.
Fig A below shows the DNS tree.

                   [ Here's where we are
		     authoritative for
                     our zone records ]  


	Fig A. The DNS tree
	-------------------

So, there are two ways to specify names, absolute or
relative.  In absolute, we specify all the way to the
root, ie, the ".", eg,

	linux-1.society.intipen.edu.my.

Relative, is where we just mention the hostname, ie,

	linux-1

Note that we do not put a  "." above. To get the FQDN,
or absoulute pathname, "society.intipen.edu.my." will be
automatically appended to it, to get:

	linux-1.society.intipen.edu.my.

By the same reasoning, looking at the zone record for
society.intipen.edu.my above,

	ns

means
	ns.society.intipen.edu.my.

and
	mail

means

	mail.society.intipen.edu.my.

Take a look at this line:

	mail		   A 		192.168.0.1

Your could also write it this way:

   mail.society.intipen.edu.my.   A   192.168.0.1


The "A" means authoritative. It means this record is the
master record for the mapping

	mail.society.intipen.edu.my.  --> 192.168.0.1


Take a look at this line:

	Linux		   CNAME	Unix 

The word "CNAME" means alias. It means:

   Linux.society.intipen.edu.my == Unix.society.intipen.edu.my

Note that the "A" name should always be on the right. Never
put a CNAME on the right. Note also that one IP can have 
multiple domain names.

Remember also that nameservers are not case-sensitive, therefore
"linux" is the same as "Linux".  If you did this: 


	linux		   A		192.168.0.1
	Unix		   A		192.168.0.2
	Annie		   A	        192.168.0.3
	Linux		   CNAME	Unix 
	Notebook	   CNAME	Unix 


Your nameserver will never be able to resolve at all anything that
ends in .society.intipen.edu.my and you will get a SERVFAIL message
when doing:

	dig linux.society.intipen.edu.my

Where's the error?  The A record has a line: "linux" which conflicts
with the CNAME's "Linux" !

means
	192.168.0.1

and
	2
means
	192.168.0.2

These IP should match the file "society.intipen.edu.my" 
described above.

Restart sendmail and check for errors as follows:

	/etc/rc.d/init.d/sendmail restart

	tail /var/log/messages

Read the errors, if any, and correct them.


Sendmail and DNS
----------------
You should set these files

	/etc/sysconfig/network

with these entries:
	
	NETWORKING=yes
	HOSTNAME="linux-1.society.intipen.edu.my"

And set this file

	/etc/hosts

with these entries:


	127.0.0.1	localhost
	192.168.0.1	linux-1.society.intipen.edu.my

In other words, you should set the server's name as
"linux-1.society.intipen.edu.my", or else, Sendmail
will take ages to start!
	
Remember to start ipop3, so that clients can remotely
retrieve mail:

	chkconfig ipop3 on
