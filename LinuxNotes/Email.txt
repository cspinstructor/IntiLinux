EMAIL
=====

Objective
---------
To set up an SMTP email Mail Transfer Agent that accepts
relaying from within the LAN to Internet and a POP server
for remote mail retrieval.  

To connect and interact with SMTP and POP servers.


Sendmail
--------
A mail transfer agent, commonly abbreviated MTA is a server
that receives email from email clients, called Mail User Agents
or, MUA, to send to other email MTA's.  

Sendmail is an MTA.  The configuartion file is 

	/etc/sendmail.cf 

and the only settings which we need to concern ourselves with are:

	
	Cwfar.scape.net
        #Cwlocalhost	
	#O DaemonPortOptions=Port=smtp,Addr=127.0.0.1, Name=MTA

where, far.scape.net, is the host name that runs sendmail, and
the Cwlocalhost and DaemonPortOptions are commented out so that
it will accept request for email forwarding from any hosts within
the LAN.  Substitute your server's name in place of far.scape.net.

To start or stop sendmail,

	/etc/rc.d/init.d/sendmail  start|stop


POP
---
The pop server is to receive remote requests from email clients
to retrieve mail from the mail box. All emails are store in

	/var/mail/username

where username is the account name of the user.  
To start or stop the pop server,

	chkconfig ipop3 on|off 

To find out whether any pop servers are running;

	chkconfig --list | grep pop



Connecting to SMTP Servers
--------------------------
To connect to an MTA, we could use any client, eg, Kmail. In the
settings dialog box, set the mail server's IP or domain name.
Port number is 25.

Alternatively, we can telnet to port 25, eg:

	telnet smtp.farscape.net 25
	[ server replies ]
	
	helo stargate
	[ server replies ]
	
	mail from:carter@stargate.net
	[ server replies ]

	rcpt to:sun@farsape.net
	[ server replies ]

	data
	[ server replies ]

	subject:Worm Holes
	date:Dec 25, 2000
	from:carter@stargate.net
	to:sun@farscape.net
	cc:crichton@farscape.net
	[  a blank line ]
	Dear Sun,

	We have a stargate.
	Are u interested in sharing your 
	wormhole technology?

	Regards,
	Carter

Note that <CRLF> above means  \r\n.\r\n , or, simply
[Enter key].[Enter key].  Programmatically you could send
"\r\n.\r\n", if you are writing a program to talk to an SMTP
server.	

Note that the "mail from:" and "from:" parameters above could
be spoofed. This is subject to abuse and possibly spamming.
As such most SMTP servers have disabled email relaying, and
only allows emails to be forwarded to its own domain. For 
example, you can connect to smtp.farscape.net to send and
email to sun@farscape.net, but, you cannot use smtp.farscape.net
to send email to theone@matrix.net . 


Connecting to POP servers
-------------------------		
You could use the GUI based Kmail described above. Just set
the pop email domain name or IP address and set the port to
port 110.

Alternatively, use fetchmail:

	fetchmail pop.farscape.net -P 110 -u sun

where pop.farscape.net is the pop server, -P 110 specifies
the port number as 110 and -u sun specifies the username to
connect as, in this case the username is "sun".

Alternative, use telnet,

	telnet pop.farscape.net 110
	[ server replies ]

	user sun
	[ server replies ]

	pass moya134
	[ server replies ]

	stat
	[ server replies with list of emails ]

	retr 1
	[ server sends first email ]

	dele 1
	[ server deletes first email ]

	retr 2
	[ server sends second email ]

	dele 2
	[ server deletes second email ]

 	quit
