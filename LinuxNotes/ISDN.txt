ISDN
======

Objective
---------
To setup an ISDN Terminal Adapter Modem  and configure it to dial up
an Internet Service Provider 


Installing a modem
-------------------
Exactly the same as for analog modem. Refer to the chapter on
Modems.txt.  ISDN TA Modem is external  - the one provided 
by TmNet's TMISDN service is

	Eicon Diva Terminal Adapter

Note that internal ISDN PCI card needs special drivers and programs
like isdn4linux.  But for TA modems, no need, they behave almost 
the same as an analog modem. They simulate an analog modem. 



Configuring ISP dial up
-----------------------
Follow the same as for the analog modem. Refer to the chapter on
Modems.txt. 

Use wvdialconf to generate the /etc/wvdial.conf file, then edit it
by setting the stupid mode as follows:

	Stupid mode = 1

The default is 0, which means, after Carrier is detected and the
1511 number is dialled, it waits for the ISP to send a prompt.
For ISDN services, there is no prompt, and the dialer should not 
wait, hence setting stupid mode to 1.

Also insert the  Username, Password and Phone. An example
is shown below:


	[Dialer Defaults]
	Modem = /dev/ttyS1
	Baud = 11500 
	Init1 = ATZ
	SetVolume = 0
	Dial Command = ATDT

	[Dialer isdn]
	Username = billgates 
	Password = mikersof
	Phone = 1511
	Inherits = Dialer Defaults
	Stupid mode = 1 



To dial, login as root, then type:

	wvdial isdn


Autodial
--------
Whenever the connection is terminated, it will try to
reconnect.  To set the wvdial to start whenever the
computer reboots, create this script called Internet.sh:

	#!/bin/sh
	wvdial isdn
	

add this entry to the file /etc/rc.d/rc.local file:

	/root/Internet.sh &

Note that you should run it as a background process so
that it will not block and cause the bootup process to
come to a grinding halt!

Also note that wvdial once started will only attempt
reconnection if the Modem is NOT switched off! So, if you 
need to control internet access, switch off the Terminal
Adapter, NOT the Modem! See Fig A:


      tel line
     ---------> Terminal Adaptor <------> Modem
					   ^
   					   | RS232
					   |
					   V
					   PC


		Fig. A. TA ISDN MODEM and PC		 
		----------------------------

Note that the Modem is connected to the PC's serial port
via RS232 serial cable using DB9 connector.
	   


Troubleshooting
---------------
Run the connection script and see the output.
Also check the /var/log/messages file.  If you see PAP 
authentication failure then, it means that your Tmnet
account has been suspended. Use another account - edit the
/etc/wvdial.conf file.  Remember, the ISDN service is only
a physical service provided by the telco.  In order to use the
Internet, you can use any TMnet account.  But remember to dial
1525 and not 1515.
