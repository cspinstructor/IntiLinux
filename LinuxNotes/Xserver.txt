    remotely.

[1] Remote Connection to Xserver
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

What is Xserver
---------------
This is the daemon that provides the Graphical User Interface,
or windows Interface. Usually, the user would connect to the 
Xserver locally. However, it is also possible to do so remotely
across the network.

Connecting to Xserver Locally
------------------------------
Simple do this:

	startx

and the Window manager will take over.  Two common window 
managers are KDE and Gnome. Whichever was set as default will
start.


Connecting accross the Network
------------------------------ 
Assume your PC is called Stargate and the remote PC is
Farscape. And you wish to connect to Farscape and run GUI-based
applications on Farscape but to display the output on Stargate.

You are sitting in front of Stargate.  All commands will be
typed on Stargate. Farscape is a thousand miles away.
You need to startx, just type:

	startx

KDE will start (assuming you set KDE as default), then, 
open an xterm within KDE. Type:

	xhost +

to disable access control list and enable all hosts to connect
to your computer. If you wanted to reenable access control, type:

	xhost -

To specifically enable a host to connect, eg, to enable Farscape to
connect to Stargate,

	xhost + Farscape

or, if you know the IP,

	xhost + 202.123.222.3

Then, you could telnet or ssh to Farscape from within the xterm
window which you open in KDE,

	ssh Farscape

after, logging in, you can run any GUI-based application program,
eg,

	gftp
	konqueror [ file browser ]
	netscape
	gphoto

However, if you had telnetted in instead of ssh, and you can't get
a connectin to Xserver,  then you may  need to
do this after having logged in via the xterm window:

	export DISPLAY=Stargate:0

However, it is advisable to use ssh for security.



Lindows Resolution Settings
---------------------------
The Default resolution for Lindows OS 2 is 1024 x 768, to change it to
800 x 600, we edit this file:   

	/etc/X11/XF86Config-4


by changing the following lines in the "#res 1024 768" section:




# res 1024 768
Section "Screen"
	Identifier	"Screen1"
	Device	"Device1"
	Monitor	"Monitor1"
	DefaultDepth	16
	SubSection	"Display"
		Depth	4
		Modes	"1024x768"	"800x600"	"640x480"
	EndSubSection
	SubSection	"Display"
		Depth	8
		Modes	"1024x768"	"800x600"	"640x480"
	EndSubSection
	SubSection	"Display"
		Depth	15
		Modes	"1024x768"	"800x600"	"640x480"
	EndSubSection
	SubSection	"Display"
		Depth	16
		Modes	"1024x768"	"800x600"	"640x480"
	EndSubSection
	SubSection	"Display"
		Depth	24
		Modes	"1024x768"	"800x600"	"640x480"
	EndSubSection
	SubSection	"Display"
		Depth	32
		Modes	"1024x768"	"800x600"	"640x480"
	EndSubSection
EndSection


Note this SubSection:


	SubSection	"Display"
		Depth	16
		Modes	"1024x768"	"800x600"	"640x480"
	EndSubSection


At the "Modes" line, delete the "1024x768" part:


	SubSection	"Display"
		Depth	16
		Modes	"800x600"	"640x480"
	EndSubSection



Then reboot.



By default, x looks at the Depth 16 SubSection as specified under 
"Default Depth", and tries all the resolutions from left to right and uses
the first one that works. This means it will try the resolutions in this order:


		"1024x768"
		"800x600"
		"640x480"

By deleting the first entry, X will try it in this order:


		"800x600"
		"640x480"

and consequently uses the "800x600" resolution.


There is no Xconfigurator utility in Lindows OS 2.





[2] How to change window managers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
For Redhat 7.x,

startx --> /usr/X11R6/bin/xinit --> checks for:
		     
		     [a] $HOME/.xinitrc
		     [b] else runs xinitrc
		     [c] /etc/X11/xinitrc
		           |
			   | checks for
			   V
		        $HOME/.Xlients, if none then
						|
						|
						V
	  	   			/etc/X11/Xclients
			   			|
			   			|checks
			   			V
					/etc/sysconfig/desktop	
			   

					for preferred Manager.

					
Therefore put your preferred manager in /etc/sysconfig/Desktop,
eg:

	DESKTOP="GNOME"

or,

	DESKTOP="KDE"

defined in /etc/X11/Xclients


GNOME is gnome-session
KDE is startkde
