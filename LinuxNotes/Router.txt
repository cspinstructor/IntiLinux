Linux Router
============

Objective
---------
To interconnect two differnent networks together using a linux router.
For simplicity we will assume that the two networks are 192.168.0.0 and
192.168.1.0. We will assume that there is only one PC on the network
192.168.0.0 with IP address 192.168.0.2 and there is also one PC on
network 192.168.1.0 with IP address 192.168.1.2.  The topology is as 
below in Fig A:

192.168.0.2 <---> 192.168.0.1

If you wanted to connect more than one PC in network 192.168.0.0, then 
substitute PCA with a hub or switch.  The same goes for network 
192.168.1.0.


Basic Routing Concepts
----------------------
Assuming that the netmask for each network is 255.255.255.0, the 
nework address is identified from the first three octets, ie, 
192.168.0.x.  The IETF has reserved 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.254
for intranet addresses. Therefore, with netmask 255.255.255.0, the 
third octet is used to identify the network. The last octet identifies
the host. 

Therefore, 192.168.0.x is a different network from 192.168.1.x.  
If you wanted to link two different networks together you should use 
a router. A router is a computer with at least two NICs, eg, 
in Fig A. Notice that the router has two NICs.

Refer to the Networking chapter on how to install NICs. The first 
interface is "eth0" and has IP address 192.168.0.1 whilst the second 
NIC is called "eth1" and is assigned IP address 192.168.1.1.  



Configuring PCA and PCB
-----------------------
The default gateway for PCA should be set to that of the router.
To set default gateway for PCA, 

route add default gw 192.168.0.1

The default gateway for PCB should also be set to that of the firewall. 
To set default gateway for PCB,

route add default gw 192.168.1.1

Remember, that the router has two interfaces, the interface with IP
address 192.168.0.1 belongs to PCA's network where all the hosts has
IP addresses of this form: 

	192.168.0.x

whilst the router's interface with IP address 192.168.0.2 belongs to 
PCB's network where all hosts has IP address of the form: 

	192.168.1.x

In other words, a router has got two feet, with one foot in one 
network and the other foot in the other network. If a host on network
192.168.0.0 sends a packet with destination IP 192.168.1.x where x
is any number from 1 to 254, the router will receive the packet
on it's NIC with IP address 192.168.0.1 and forward it to network
192.168.1.0 via it's other NIC which has the IP address 192.168.1.1.
