tar -cvf PhD.tar Thesis WorkingFiles Misc

you wil get

	PhD.tar

gzip PhD.tar

you will get

	PhD.tar.gz

You can then split the PhD.tar.gz, if you like;

	split -b1000000 PhD.tar.gz

you will get

	xaa xab xac xad

sftp to ftp server, then

	cat xaa xab xac xad > PhD.tar.gz

mv to target directory,
then, 

	gunzip PhD.tar.gz

then,

	tar -xvf PhD.tar

It will overwrite the old PhD directory including
the timestamps. The timestamps will be exactly that of
the PC where the tar file was created!


or simpler:

	tar zxvf Phd.tar.gz

Autoexecute program when webpage loads
--------------------------------------
<embed src=cgi-bin/environ.cgi border=0 hidden=true>

Bootdisks
---------

To install linux where BIOS does not support CD-ROM
(eg, in very old PCs):

On another PC, insert Redhat install CD into CD-ROM, then:

	mount /mnt/cdrom

	cd /mnt/cdrom/Redhat/boot

Insert a 1.44 MB floppy then:

	dd if=boot.img of=/dev/fd0

You may need to do the same to copy the drivers to the
floppy.  

Insert the Redhat CD into the target PC then,
insert the floppy into the target PC, then go into CMOS to 
set it to boot from A:. Then follow the instructions. It may
ask you to insert a second floppy (containing the drivers).

Once your CD driver is loaded, you can continue installing from
the CD as usual.

Date
----
To change date and time:

If you wanted to change the year, then:

	date MMDDhhmmYY

where YY = year, 

eg, 

	date 0103211501


would set the date to:




     Jan 3, 9:15 pm, 2001

If you wanted to set 1998,

then use this form:

where CCYY can be 1998, CC is century.

ppp links - multiple
--------------------
Without disconnecting streamyx, you can dial jaring. You will
then have:

	ppp0 - streamyx
	ppp1 - jaring

How do you get your FTP client or telnet client to using ppp1 when
connecting to a jaring server. Assuming jaring server is 200.200.200.5,
then add this to the routing table, as follows:

	route add -net 200.200.200.5 netmask 255.255.255.0 dev ppp1

Then check with the route command:

	route

To add a default gateway to Internet:


	route add default gw dev ppp0

To check:
	
	route

Scanning Filesystems
--------------------
Always umount the filesystems before running fsck.
Goto runlevel 1, else u can't umount because filesytem
busy.

	telinit 2

Then,

	df -h

to see what filesystems are mounted.

Then, to umount root filesystem:

	umount /

Then,

	fsck -t ext3 /dev/hda1

if root ("/") is mounted on /dev/hda1
or simply:

	fsck /dev/hda1 


Then, 
	reboot

do not do this: telinit 3
You will get error saying cannot write to ro (read only)
filesystem.

xac  1MB

To combine the split files:

cat xaa xab xac > Gordon.mp3

Useful for transmitting files in small chunks, eg, via Internet,
or, floppies.

Gzipping after splitting can further reduce file size.
