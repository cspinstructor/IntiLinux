ADSL
====

Objective
---------
To setup ADSL static & dynamic IP connection for TmNet Streamyx.
The ADSL static connection uses an ADSL Router, whilst the Dynamic one uses an ADSL Bridge (also known as PPPoE - PPP on Ethernet).  ADSL Bridge allows Linux to be the router and firewall. More flexibility.  

What is ADSL?
-------------
ADSL stands for Asynchronous Digital Subscriber Line.
Download speed is 384 kbps and upload speed is 128 kbps,
but for Corporate ADSL, it may be much faster. It uses
the ordinary telephone copper line to carry computer digital
data and also voice data. 


Setting Up an ADSL static IP connection
----------------------------------------
Static IP ADSL is usually subscribed by corporations.
The modem supplied is Tmnet is Lucent ADSL Router. A UTP cable
connects the ADSL Router to the NIC of the Firewall/Computer.
You need to set the Firewall/Computer to the IP address
assigned by your ISP. Fig A below shows the physical
components.

Fig B. below shows an example with specifics. Assuming
that TmNet assigns 200.200.200.2 for your ADSL modem and
200.200.200.1 for your LAN Gateway or Firewall. Assuming
the Firewall is installed with 2 NIC's, ie, 3Com and Accton.

192.168.0.4

	Fig B.  An ADSL plus Firewall Setup


In the above, you should set the default gateway for each host
in the LAN to 192.168.0.1. And set the default gateway for
200.200.200.2 to the 200.200.200.1 

If, on the other hand, you are not sharing the line, then
there is no need for a Firewall. In such a case, just
connect the ADSL directly to the PC, and set the PC's IP
to 200.200.200.2 with default gateway to 200.200.200.1 as in
Fig. C below:

                    UTP cable

    Fig C.  An ADSL connection with no Firewall




Note that the router itself usually has a public web interface on port 80. You could use another PC, connect to http://192.168.1.1 and configure the router.


Setting Up an ADSL dynamic IP connection
----------------------------------------
Home dynamic IP ADSL can be router or bridge based. Initially, for
for Home Dynamic IP ADSL, TmNet Streamyx package provides  Aztech
Turbo 900 series bridge modem. Today, it is common to find home users using router ADSL modem as well. If you are using a router ADSL, then connect to the web interface to set the public IP as 0.0.0.0 so that it can autodetect the dynamic IP that is assigned by Streamyx. Also set the DNS servers 202.188.0.133 and 202.188.1.5.

The instructions below assumes you are using an ADSL bridge modem. The connection to the PC is the same as
Fig D, below.

Note that in dynamic IP, you do not set the IP address
of the NIC of the Firewall/Computer. The architecture is as shown
in Fig D below.

	Fig E.  A ADSL - Firewall Setup for Dynamic IP 

TmNet will provide the Splitter (or Filter),
ADSL Modem and WinPOET software (which runs only on 
Win98/ME/XP/2000). Linux uses rp-pppoe, which will be 
explained later. PPPOE stands for "PPP on Ethernet".

To check if it is already installed:

	whereis adsl-connect
	rpm -qf adsl-connect

or
	rpm -qa rp-pppoe*

If it is not installed, download from www.roaringpenguin.com.
Latest as of time of writing is:
	
	rp-pppoe-3.5-1.i386.rpm

Also get the optional gui frontend: 

	rp-pppoe-gui-3.5-1.i386.rpm

Login as root and install using the rpm command:

	
	rpm -U rp-pppoe-3.5-1.i386.rpm
	rpm -U rp-pppoe-gui-3.5-1.i386.rpm

Note the -U is to update from earlier versions of rp-pppoe.
You could use -i also, which means install.
If you wanted to see more interactive details while the packages is
being installed:

	rpm -Uvh ...
	
	where,
		v is for uniform number of hash marks, and,
		h is for hash marks

Then run the adsl-setup script. This script will ask you a series
of questions and save the information given by the user into a
configuration file called:

	/etc/ppp/pppoe.conf

Usual particulars include:

	#Ethernet card connected to ADSL modem
	ETH='eth0'
	
	#ADSL user name
	USER='xyz@tmnet'

	#Bring up on demand? If you set yes, it will disconnect
	#on idle. Doesn't work well with dynamic IP. You should
	#set no for all ADSL whether Static or Dynamic, so that
	#it will forever attempt to reconnect whenever the  
	#connection is lost and it will never drop the line even if 
	#it is idle
	DEMAND=no
		
	#DNS type: SERVER=obtain from server
	DNSTYPE=SERVER

	#Obtain DNS server addresses from peer
	PEERDNS=yes
	DNS1=     [ blank ]
	DNS2=	  [ blank ]

	#Make PPPoE connection the default route
	DEFAULTROUTE=yes

	#Connect Timeout set to 0 so that it will forever try to
	#to reconnect after adsl-start is called
	CONNECT_TIMEOUT=0

	ACNAME=      [ blank ]
	SERVICENAME= [ blank ]

	#Use synchronous PPP? I used no, but yes should
	#be less strain on CPU and should also work
	SYNCHRONOUS=no	

	#Clam MSS should set to 1412 if Firewall is gateway for LAN
	CLAMPMSS=1412

	#LCP echo inerval and failure count
	LCP_INTERVAL=20
	LCP_FAILURE=3

	PPPOE_TIMEOUT=80
		
	#Firewalling: Set none if you have your own
	FIREWALL=NONE

	LINUX_PLUGIN=  [ blank ]

	#Any extra argument to pass to pppoe
	PPPOE_EXTRA=""

	#Any extra arguments to pass to pppd
	PPPD_EXTRA=""


Note that the password is stored in:

	/etc/ppp/pap-secrets
	/etc/ppp/chap-secrets

and not in the pppoe.conf file.


Then, to connect, enter the command:

	adsl-connect
or
  	 /usr/sbin/adsl-connect /etc/ppp/pppoe.conf

To get the status:

	adsl-status

To stop the connection:

	adsl-stop

It is also known as dial-up connection. But there is no number
to dial up, just a script to connect to and login to the ISP's server.
Each time the connection is made, a different IP address is assigned.



Autostart on reboot
------------------
Edit /etc/rc.d/rc.local with these:

adsl-start &
/etc/init.d/firewall-2.4.drop start
route add default dev ppp0


Notice the "&" in the rc.local script.  This makes the Start.sh
script run as a background process. Failure to do this will
cause linux to stop booting when it executes the Start.sh script,
because it will "block" when it executes the script, which in turn,
prevents linux from completing the bootup process.



Auto Reconnect
--------------
For both the static IP and also the dynamic IP setups, once
you do adsl-connect, the system will attempt to reconnect should
the line gets disconnected. The connect-timeout default is 30 seconds.
This means after 30 seconds, it will give up trying to reconnect. If
you want it to forever try to reconnect, then edit the pppoe.conf,
or, the conf.name file, by setting:

	CONNECT_TIMEOUT=0



Finding out the Dynamic IP address
==================================
For the dynamic IP setup, the IP address keeps changing each time
it reconnects after a line-drop.  How can a system administrator
ssh to the firewall to do system administration? A simple solution
is to crontab the Firewall to send its IP address to a remote
box every minute.  The Firewall should have a script to check
the IP address.  The remote box should have a script to listen for
the connection from the Firewall. The architecture is as shown
in Fig F below:

Remote
Linux 						    Firewall with
Server  <-------------> Internet <---------->   Dynamic IP 
listens						    Address connects
on port						    to port 88888 
88888

     Fig F.  IP Notification System for Dynamic IP ADSL 


The Firewall part
------------------
An example script called Check.sh is listed below:

[ Check.sh ]
------------------------------------------------------------
#!/bin/sh

/sbin/ifconfig > ifconfig.txt
    
 
if  grep eth0 ifconfig.txt     
then
  echo -n "Firewall: " > out.txt
  date >> out.txt
  echo  "---------------------------------------- " >> out.txt
  grep "P-t-P:" ifconfig.txt >> out.txt
  echo >> out.txt
  nc 202.188.12.3  88888 < out.txt	
fi
---------------------------------------------------------------

The above script should be run on the Firewall which is
connecting to Internet using the ADSL connection discussed earlier.
Notice the line "nc 192.168.20.3 33333 < out"

nc is the "netcat" program.  It is like a telnet program. In this
case it will connect to the Remote Linux Server (assuming IP address
is 202.188.12.3) which is listening on port 88888 and send the
file "out.txt".

The file contains the IP address of the Firewall.


We need to create a schedule which regularly runs the Check.sh
script.  For this, we could use "cron".  Cron is a system which
can set timetables for doing tasks at predetermined dates and times.
For our purpose, we would want the Firewall to run the Check.sh
every minute.  In order to do that, we type:

	crontab -e

This will open the cron table for editing.  We then the following:

	
	0-59 * * * * /home/sysadmin/Check.sh

Alternatively, if you wanted the crontab to run Check.sh every
15 minutes:

	0,15,30,45 * * * * /home/sysadmin/Check.sh

Then, quit by typing "[ESC]:wq", ie, the vi editor command for
writing and quitting.  We then check the table to confirm that
the cron table is set correctly:

	crontab -l

The above means list the cron table.
To check whether the "cron" daemon is running:

	/etc/rc.d/init.d/crond status

If it is not running, you can start it:

	/etc/rc.d/init.d/crond start

Note:
One side effect of cron is that it will email a message to
root whenever it executes a task on its table.  This causes
root mailbox to fill up quickly. You need to tell cron not to
notify root, or, alternatively, to clear the mbox regularly.

The Remote Linux Server part
----------------------------
Just write and run this script called Server.sh: 

[ Server.sh ]
------------------------------- 
#!/bin/sh
nc -l -p 88888
--------------------------------

It causes netcat to listen on port 88888. After, at the
most, 1 minute, the Firewall will connect and send its
IP address.  The Server.sh will receive it and display on
monitor and quit.

If you wish to keep a log of all the Firewall IP's:

	./Server.sh >> IP.log



Frequent disconnects
--------------------
This is a common problem, as seen in /var/log/messages:


	Inactivity timeout... something wicked happened on session 4214
	Sent PADT
	Modem hangup
	Connection terminated.
	Connect time 4.4 minutes. Sent 424374 bytes, received 16215462 bytes.
	/etc/hotplug/net.agent: NET unregister event not supported
	Exit.
	ADSL connection lost; attempting re-connection.


Solution:

Change one line in the configuration file 
	
	/etc/ppp/pppoe.conf

from
	LCP_INTERVAL=20
to
	LCP_INTERVAL=5 

Also, should set 

	CONNECT_TIMEOUT=30

to

	CONNECT_TIMEOUT=0

so that it will forever keep on trying upon disconnect, instead
of giving up after 30 seconds.

Notice the line "nc 192.168.20.3 33333 < out"

nc is the "netcat" program.  It is like a telnet program. In this
case it will connect to the Remote Linux Server (assuming IP address
is 202.188.12.3) which is listening on port 88888 and send the
file "out.txt".

The file contains the IP address of the Firewall.


We need to create a schedule which regularly runs the Check.sh
script.  For this, we could use "cron".  Cron is a system which
can set timetables for doing tasks at predetermined dates and times.
For our purpose, we would want the Firewall to run the Check.sh
every minute.  In order to do that, we type:

	crontab -e

This will open the cron table for editing.  We then the following:

	
	0-59 * * * * /home/sysadmin/Check.sh

Alternatively, if you wanted the crontab to run Check.sh every
15 minutes:

	0,15,30,45 * * * * /home/sysadmin/Check.sh

Then, quit by typing "[ESC]:wq", ie, the vi editor command for
writing and quitting.  We then check the table to confirm that
the cron table is set correctly:

	crontab -l

The above means list the cron table.
To check whether the "cron" daemon is running:

	/etc/rc.d/init.d/crond status

If it is not running, you can start it:

	/etc/rc.d/init.d/crond start

Note:
One side effect of cron is that it will email a message to
root whenever it executes a task on its table.  This causes
root mailbox to fill up quickly. You need to tell cron not to
notify root, or, alternatively, to clear the mbox regularly.

The Remote Linux Server part
----------------------------
Just write and run this script called Server.sh: 

[ Server.sh ]
------------------------------- 
#!/bin/sh
nc -l -p 88888
--------------------------------

It causes netcat to listen on port 88888. After, at the
most, 1 minute, the Firewall will connect and send its
IP address.  The Server.sh will receive it and display on
monitor and quit.

If you wish to keep a log of all the Firewall IP's:

	./Server.sh >> IP.log



Frequent disconnects
--------------------
This is a common problem, as seen in /var/log/messages:


	Inactivity timeout... something wicked happened on session 4214
	Sent PADT
	Modem hangup
	Connection terminated.
	Connect time 4.4 minutes. Sent 424374 bytes, received 16215462 bytes.
	/etc/hotplug/net.agent: NET unregister event not supported
	Exit.
	ADSL connection lost; attempting re-connection.


Solution:

Change one line in the configuration file 
	
	/etc/ppp/pppoe.conf

from
	LCP_INTERVAL=20
to
	LCP_INTERVAL=5 

Also, should set 

	CONNECT_TIMEOUT=30

to

	CONNECT_TIMEOUT=0

so that it will forever keep on trying upon disconnect, instead
of giving up after 30 seconds.
