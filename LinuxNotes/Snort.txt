SNORT
=====

Objective
---------

Snort is an Open Source IDS - Intrusion Detection System. Unlike, Tripwire,
it detects attack attempts. Tripwire only detectes the Intrusion after
the fact. In my humble opinion IDS's should rightly be called ADS - 
Attack Detection Systems. IDS is a misnomer.

	
	Snort = ADS
	
	Tripwire = IDS





Getting Snort
-------------
Latest version is Snort 2. The installation and startup is different.
Skip to  SNORT 2 below.

Available from: www.snort.org

snort version 1.9.1 was used with RedHat Linux 7.2 in this project

Install:   rpm -Uvh snort-1.9.1-1snort.i386.rpm



Network Architecture
---------------------

                    Routing
    Internet <-->  Firewall  <-->  IDS   <--> Hub <--> LAN
                  [Iptables]     [Snort]



		Fig 1.  LAN with Firewall and IDS
		---------------------------------



Fig 1 above shows the setup in my lab.

The snort listens on interface ppp0 - the Internet interface.
Note that ppp0 is linked to eth1, which does not have any
IP address. 

Internet is via ADSL which connects to eth1 physically.

Routing Firewall and IDS are on the same machine. 



Configuration
-------------

Configure the /etc/snort/snort.conf file

snip.........................
# or you can specify the variable to be any IP address
# like this:

var HOME_NET any

# Set up the external network addresses as well.  
# A good start may be "any"

var EXTERNAL_NET any

snip...............................



Only enable the two variables above. The rest, do not
set.




Location of Log files
---------------------

In  /var/log/snort/





Starting Snort
--------------
Create a script:


[StartSnort.sh]

#!/bin/sh
snort -A full -c /etc/snort/snort.conf  &



chmod 755 StartSnort.sh

and start it:


	./StartSnort.sh




Comparing logs
--------------

At time of writing,  common attacks are the Web-IIS's ida, cmd.exe and scripts.
Many Streamyx's machines 219.94.x.x and 219.93.x.x appear to be executing network
scans for Web-IIS's vulnerabilities, including against Apache Servers!!??
This causes widespread DoS (Denial of Service) - causing slow response times.



Compare 


	/var/log/httpd/access_log


and

	/var/log/snort/alert




SNORT 2
~~~~~~~

snort-2.0.2-5.i386.rpm
snortrules-stable.tar.gz

Install:

rpm -Uvh  snort-2.0.2-5.i386.rpm

You may need to install libpcap first, just insert Redhat CD2
and rpm -Uvh libpcap-....rpm


Upon successful installation you will see this message:

Fetch the latest snort rules file from:

	www.snort.org

Install the rules:

cd /etc/snort
tar zxvf snortrules-stable.tar.gz 

You will get /etc/snort/rules directory containing all the rules and
a duplicate copy of snort.conf which is already in /etc/snort

Edit /etc/snort/snort.conf:

	var RULE_PATH /etc/snort/rules


Apart from the above, there is no need to change anything else in
the snort.conf file. The defaults are OK.


Then copy these 2 files from rules to /etc/snort:

	classification.config
	reference.config


Then start snort:

	/etc/rc.d/init.d/snortd start

Check to see if it is OK:

	/etc/rc.d/init.d/snortd status

If you see:

	snort dead but subsys locked

Then, there is an error, snort did not start. To find out the error,
do this:

	tail -f /var/log/messages

and correct the error accordingly. The most common errors are:

	could not open rules files.....
	could not open classification .config
	could not open reference.config


Not necessary to remove the lock file:

	/var/lock/subsys/snort

Just stop and restart snort after rectifying the problems.

The log files are in:

	/var/log/snort/

The config files are in:

	/etc/snort/

The start and stop script is:

	/etc/rc.d/init.d/snortd


To read the snort log, which is a binary:

	snort -r snort.log.123456789 | tee snort.txt

The alert file can be read directly, since it is a text file.

Or, you could download one of the many snort log reader from the
Internet.

Another troubleshooting method:

	snort -c /etc/snort/snort.conf



Two ways to start snort:

1.  Using /etc/rc.d/init.d/snortd start

2. [StartSnort.sh]
	#!/bin/sh
	snort -A full -c /etc/snort/snort.conf  &

The first method, no.1 will log a unified file in
/var/log/snort/snort.log.1234567

The second method, no.2 will log each attacker under the
attacker's respective IP directory in /var/log/snort/


The contents are the same for both methods, just that in the unified log,
all attackers are lumped together in one file instead of separate.

We could, however, amend snortd script by changing this line:

snip......................................
# See how we were called.
case "$1" in
  start)
	echo -n "Starting snort: "
	snort -A full -c /etc/snort/snort.conf  &
snip......................................
