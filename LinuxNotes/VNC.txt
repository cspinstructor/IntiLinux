VNC (Virtual Network Computing)
==============================

Objective
---------
To install, setup and use VNC.


What is VNC?
------------
VNC is an Open Source software used to remotely view a Desktop of 
a computer across the Internet/Network and to run commands remotely
by clicking on the icons in the Desktop as though it were local.

Useful for:

	1.  Network Management & Monitoring
	    eg, using your office Linux computer to access
	    your home Windows computer to start or stop
	    a webcam

	2.  Using Windows PC to access desktops of
	    other computers with different OS.
	    eg,	using your home windows computer to access
            the desktop of your linux PC

	3.  Save costs by sharing one monitor with many PCs.



Where to get it?
----------------
VNC is developed by AT&T Labs and University of Cambridge,
Dept of Engineering. It comes with RedHat Linux 8.  But, for
earlier distros, we need to download it from:

http://www.uk.research.att.com/vnc/index.html

At time of writing, the latest version is vnc-3.3.7.


Architecture
------------
The installation binary comes with vncserver and vncviewer


	[ Win9x/ME/XP/2000 ]   [ Linux ]
             vncviewer  <-----> vncserver 
	     vncserver  <-----> vncclient

	Fig A.  VNC server and client
	-----------------------------


In Fig A. the vncviewer on Windows can view the desktop
of the Linux's Xwindow.  On the other hand, the Linux viewer
can view the windows Desktop.



Installation
============

Linux
-----
	
	gunzip vnc-3.3.7-x86_linux.tar.gz
	tar -xvf vnc-3.3.7-x86_linux.tar


	cd  vnc-3.3.7-x86_linux/

You will see the following files


	vncconnect
	vncinstall
	vncpasswd
	vncserver
	vncviewer
	Xvnc
	Xvnc.man
	vncconnect.man
	vncpasswd.man
	vncserver.man
	vncviewer.man


Run the installation program:

	vncinstall  <installation-directory> [<man-page-directory>]

e.g.   
	vncinstall /usr/local/bin


You can change the vncserver password by running the vncpassd program.




Configuration
-------------
Configuration file is in your home directory:

	 /home/paul/.vnc/xstartup


snip..................................................
#!/bin/sh

[ -r $HOME/.Xresources ] && xrdb $HOME/.Xresources
xsetroot -solid grey
xterm -geometry 80x24+10+10 -ls -title "$VNCDESKTOP Desktop" &
startkde &
snip.....................................................


The default windows manager is twm, change it to your favourite,
in the above example, I use startkde.



For the Windows' version, do not change any of the default
config, leave the following ticked:

	[ Incoming Connections ]
	Accept Socket Connections
	Display Number - Auto	
	Enable Java Viewer


	[ When Last Client Disconnects ]
	Do Nothing
	

	[ Update Handling ]
	Poll Foreground Window
	Poll Console Windows Only


Leave all others unticked.



Win9x/ME/XP/2000
---------------
Install the windows version on the Windows box.




STARTING THE SERVER
-------------------

Linux:   vncserver

Windows: double click on vncserver icon.

Linux vncserver listens on port 5901 by default.
Windows vncserver listens on port 5900 by default.

It may be a good idea to do this:

	vncserver -geometry 800x600


because the default is 1024x768, which is too big for the Windows
Desktop.


To stop the linux vncserver:

	 killall -9  Xvnc



CONNCECTING TO THE SERVER
-------------------------

Linux connecting to Windows:

	vncviewer 192.168.0.3:0

	[ie, port 5900]


Windows connecting to Linux:

	click on vncviewer icon and in the textbox, enter:

	192.168.0.1:1

	[ie, port 5901]
	



CONNECTING TO A SERVER WHICH IS BEHIND A FIREWALL
--------------------------------------------------

Assuming the architecture as in Fig B below:


     Client                        |  Linux   |       VNC
      PC    ----> [ INTERNET ] --> | Firewall | <--> Server
                                   |          |

	 Fig B. Traversing a firewall 
	 ----------------------------


Configure the firewall such that whenever there is an inbound
request to port 5900, it should be DNAT to the internal 
IP address 192.168.0.3 port 5900 (for Windows vncserver), or
port 5901 (for Linux vncserver).


Insert this rule in your firewall script:


	$IPTABLES -t nat -A PREROUTING -i $EXTIF -p tcp --dport 5900 \
 		  -j DNAT --to-destination 192.168.0.3:5900 


See the chapter Firewall.txt for firewall details.
