ALIEN
=====

Objective
---------
Using alien to convert *.rpm to *.deb and installing it
on lindows v 2.0.
The rpm's are j2re and openoffice packages.


What is alien?
--------------
A tool to convert .rpm to .deb packages.
rpm is Redhat package manager format, 
deb is debian package format.


What to install
---------------
We are going to install this on lindows v2.0:

	/usr/local/j2re-1_4_1_03-fcs-linux-i586.rpm
	
Note that lindows is Debian-derivative.

Next, we will install the 3 openoffice packages:


	openoffice-1.0.1-8.i386.rpm
	openoffice-i18n-1.0.1-8.i386.rpm
	openoffice-libs-1.0.1-8.i386.rpm



Installing alien
----------------
We need alien, to convert the rpm to deb.

Therefore, first, install alien:

	apt-get install alien








Installing jre
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Converting rpm to deb
---------------------

Then, convert the rpm to deb:

	alien j2re-1_4_1_03-fcs-linux-i586.rpm

After conversion, the original rpm is untouched, but a new
deb has been created:

	
	/usr/local/j2re_1.4.1_03-1_i386.deb



Installing the deb
------------------
Then, install the deb package:

	dpkg -i	j2re_1.4.1_03-1_i386.deb

It installs like an rpm.



Where did it install?
---------------------
To find out where did the deb install:

	dpkg -p j2re


There will be a long list, but you will notice this line
repeatedly:

	/usr/java.....






Installing openoffice
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Converting rpm's to deb's
-------------------------
Copy the openoffice rpm's from Redhat 8's CD2 to
/usr/local/packages.

Change to the directory where the openoffice rpm's are:

	cd /usr/local/packages

Then, convert all three rpm's to deb:

	alien openoffice*


After conversion, we get:

	
	openoffice-i18n_1.0.1-9_i386.deb
	openoffice-libs_1.0.1-9_i386.deb
	openoffice_1.0.1-9_i386.deb


To install without facing dependencies problems, install all
simultaneously:

	dpkg --install openoffice*



Errors
------
The 3 openoffice packages installed without any problems.
But when i try to run openoffice:

	oopenoffice

It complains cannot find:

	libstdc++...

So, i inserted Redhat CD1, copied, libstdc++-3.2-7.i386.rpm to
/usr/local/packages, then converted it to deb:

	alien libstdc++-3.2-7.i386.rpm

and got this:

	libstdc++_3.2-8_i386.deb


Then, i installed it:

	dpkg -i libstdc++_3.2-8_i386.deb

It installed without a hitch.

Then, i tried running openoffice again:

	ooffice

This time, it didn't complain about libstdc++, but
complained about other libraries.

At this point, i stopped.
