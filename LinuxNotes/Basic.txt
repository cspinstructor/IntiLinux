BASIC LINUX COMMANDS
====================

Objective
---------
This chapter will introduce the basic linux commands:

	ls, pwd, cd, mkdir, touch, rm, cp, mv

The Shell
---------
The shell is where the user types commands. Typically a shell looks like this:

	$_

The user types commands at the shell prompt.


Linux Directory Structure
-------------------------
The structure of the Linux directory tree is shown in Fig A below:

			/

  -----------------------------------------------------------------
  |     |    |     |    |    |    |    |    |     |    |     |     |      
 bin  sbin  dev  home  lib  var  etc  tmp  proc  usr  boot  root  opt

Default Directory
-----------------
Whenever a user logs in, he will end up in his home directory under
the directory home. Eg, if his user name is adrian, he will end up
in the directory:

	/home/adrian


Listing Directory
-----------------
To list the contents of the directory, type "ls" at the shell prompt.
To list the details of the directory, use "ls -l".

	$ls -l


Print Working Directory
-----------------------
To find out where you are, type "pwd" which stands for "print working
directory".

	$pwd



Changing Directory
------------------
To change to another directory, type "cd [new directory]".
For example, if user "adrian" has a subdirectory "MyDir" in his 
home directory,

	$cd MyDir

To return or go up to a parent directory,

	$cd ..

If you keep typing "cd ..", you will continue to go up to the parent
directory until you reach "/", the root directory.  You can't go any 
higher than that.  

Note:  Do not confuse the "/" directory with the "/root" directory. 
The latter is where the administrator keeps his files. The system 
administrator is also known as root.

Another way of changing directory is to use the full pathname:

	$cd /tmp

The above will change to the "tmp" directory under the "/" root
directory.

If you type "cd" without any paramters, you will go straight to your
own directory, no matter where you may be in the directory tree.


Summary
=======

cd  [ Change Directory ]
-----------------------
cd /home/tmp
to go back to home directory, just type cd and enter

cp  [ copy file ]
-----------------
cp sourcefile  destinationfile

ls  [ List Directory ]
---------------------
ls -l  [ full listing ]
ls     [ short listing ]

mv  [ move file or rename file ]
-------------------------------
mv file1  /tmp [ moving ]
mv oldname newname [ renaming ]

:wq      write and quit
:q!      quit without saving
