LAPLINK
-------

Objective
---------
To connect  two linux box using a null modem cable.
In this case we will connect a Notebook to a Desktop
using the Serial Port.


1.  SETTING UP THE NOTEBOOK
Assume Notebook is the server. Change to directory /etc/ppp and
create a file called "options.ttyS0" with the following contents:

asyncmap 0
crtscts
local
silent
192.168.1.172:192.168.1.8
115200

Another file called "options" should have only one line:

lock

Also edit the /etc/hosts file by adding:

192.168.1.172	inux
192.168.1.8	ion

inux is the notebook. ion is the desktop.


2.  SETTING UP THE DESKTOP
Assume Desktop PC is the client. Change to directory /etc/ppp and
create a file called "options.ttyS1" with the following contents:

115200
crtscts
local

The "options" file should also have only one line:

lock

Create the same entries in /etc/hosts as was done for the 
notebook.


3.  CONNECTING THE LAPLINK CABLE
The Laplink cable has DB25 and DB9 female connectors on both ends.
Connect the DB9 into the Notebook and the other end, connect 
DB25 to the Desktop PC.  The notebook listens on /dev/ttyS0 whilst
the desktop pc sends on /dev/ttyS1.


4.  STARTING THE pppd programs
On the notebook, run the command:

	/usr/sbin/pppd /dev/ttyS0 nodetach

On the desktop, pc run the command:

	/usr/sbin/pppd /dev/ttyS1 nodetach

The notebook must listen first, before the desktop connects.


5.  HOW USE THE PPP CONNECTION
ping each other to test connectivity.
telnet each other, ftp, etc...
