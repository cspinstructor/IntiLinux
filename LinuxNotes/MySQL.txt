MySQL
=====

Objective
---------
Configuring and running MySQL Server.


Getting MySQL
-------------
MySQL is pre-installed in RedHat 7.2 Linux distribution.
The most comprehensive guide is the MySQL Documentation
available from the MySQL web-site. But it is not easy to read,
hence, this chapter. 

Installing Database
-------------------
The binaries are found in:

	/usr/bin/

To install the database, type:

	mysql_install_db

If you get an error about not being able to lookup hostname,
you can set the hostname with this command:

	hostname linux-1.society.intipen.edu.my

After successfully running "mysql__install_db", start the 
mysqld server:

	/etc/rc.d/init.d/mysqld start


The default built-in user is "root" and it has no password
by default! To connect to mysqld server as root:

	mysql -u user -p
	Enter password: [Press Enter - since no password]

	msql>

Now you're in. First thing to do is change set root password.

	msql>set password for root=password('toor');
	Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

Root password is successfully set as "toor". To quit:

	msql>quit;



The mysql databases are all located in:

	/var/lib/mysql/



Adding New Users
----------------
First, connect and login as root:

	mysql -u root -p
	Enter password:

	mysql>

Then, to grant all privileges for ALL databases to paul
(blanket power!):

	mysql>grant all privileges on *.* to paul@localhost
             >identified by 'somepassword' with grant option;

Paul can then connect while logged in at the localhost:

	mysql -u paul -p
	Enter password:

	mysql>

If Paul wanted to log in from a remote machine, he can't.
To allow Paul to log in remotely, as root, do this:

	mysql>use mysql;
	mysql>grant all privileges on *.* to paul@'%'
             >identified by 'somepassword' with grant option;

Note the syntax:   paul@'%'
It means paul can log in remotely from ANY host.
You can also use:  paul@"%"

For Paul to remotely log in, he should type:

   mysql -u paul -p -h linux-1.society.intipen.edu.my


Paul can change his password as follows:

	mysql>set password for paul=password('secret');



SQL
---
You can view tables as follows.
First select a database, eg, to select "mysql" database:

	mysql>use mysql;
	
To view the columns host, user and password from the user
table:

	mysql>select host,user,password from user;


How to Create New Database
---------------------------
To create the database:

	mysql>create database menagerie;
        mysql>use menagerie;

Then create a table:

        mysql>create table pet (name VARCHAR(20), 
             >owner VARCHAR(20),species VARCHAR(20),
             >sex CHAR(1), birth DATE, death DATE);

You can see the databases:

	mysql>show databases;

or, show tables:

	mysql>show tables;
              

or, to see the datatypes for each field:

	mysql>describe pet;



You can load a new database from a text file where each
field is separated by a TAB delimiter. Eg, you can save
an excel file as .txt file with TAB delimiter. Then, to
load the data into MySQL:

	mysql>load data local infile "pet.txt"
             >into table pet;


To manually insert record:

   mysql>insert into pet
        >values('Puffball','David','rat','f',2000-01-01,NULL);


To view all records for all fields:

	mysql>select * from pet;

To update a record:

	mysql>update pet set name="David" where name="Bill";


Login to preselected database
-----------------------------
To login to a specific database;

	mysql -u paul -p mysql;


Login to a specific host
------------------------
To login to a specific host;

	mysql -u paul -p -h linux-1.society.intipen.edu.my


Global database delete
-----------------------
If you mess up the databases really bad, do this as a last
resort:

	cd /var/lib/mysql
	rm -fr *

But make sure you know what you are doing!!

Then, start from fresh:

	mysql_install_db

Remember, all your previous data is completely wiped out!


Scripting
---------
MySQL commands can be run as a script with .sql extension,
eg:

snip........................................

#!/bin/sh
# sql.sh logins and runs the test.sql script

echo Content-type:text/plain
echo
mysql -u paul -psecretpasswd < test.sql 

snip.......................................

snip..........................................

use stu

select * from student where name like "%";
quit

snip..........................................
