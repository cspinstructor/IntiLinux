PGP (Pretty Good Privacy)
=========================

Objective
---------
How to install GnuPG on linux.



Where to get it
---------------

GnuPG is obtainable free from
http://www.gnupg.org

This is the GNU version of PGP. 



Unpacking and Installing
-----------------------
The distribution is gnupg-1.2.1.tar.bz2.
To unzip and unpack:

	bunzip2 gnupg-1.2.1.tar.bz2
	tar -xvf  gnupg-1.2.1.tar.bz2



After unpacking, goto the directory and do:

	chmod 755 configure
	./configure

to configure the Makefile for your target
system. Then, to compile the binaries, do:

	make


Then, install it:

	make install



Using PGP
--------

Generate a Key Pair:

	gpg --gen-key

To import a public key:

	gpg --import pub_key.asc

To import a private key:

	gpg --allow-secret-key-import --import sec_key.asc

To encrypt a file with a recipient's public key:

	gpg -r "Bill Gates"  -ea  message

The -a is to encrypt in armor format (ascii), and -r is 
recipient. List the public-keys to see a list of recipients.


To list public-keys:

	gpg --list-keys


To decrypt a file with your private key:

	gpg  -o msg.txt -d message.asc 



To send email, encrypt the message with the recipient's 
public-key, then paste the contents of the .asc file
inside the body of the email message.

To decrypt email sent to you, just do the reverse,
copy the contents of the email into a file ending
with extension .asc, then decrypt the file with your
private key.



Digital signature
-----------------
To sign and encrypt:

	gpg -sea -r "paul" message

where,
-s is sign, -e is encrypt, -a is armored format,
-r is recipient


To verify signature:

	gpg -o msg.txt -d message.asc

That is, it will, BOTH  decrypt AND verify.



Front end
---------
This front end is not necessary if you decide to use
GnuPG on the command line.

Download the GUI frontend called GPA from
http://www.gnupg.org.


Unpack it. cd to the directory and do:

	chmod 755 configure
	./configure

to configure the Makefile for your target
system. Then, to compile the binaries, do:

	make


Then, install it:

	make install


Conventional Encryption
-----------------------
Also known as symmetrical encryption, the
password for encryption and decryption is the same:


Encrypt:

	gpg -c  file


You will be asked for passphrase. It need not be
the same as your private/secret key.
You will get a ciphertext file: file.gpg


Decrypt:

	gpg -d file.gpg > file

You will be asked for passphrase.



Changing Passphrase 
-------------------

To change the private/secret key passphrase:

	gpg --edit-key bill passwd

Enter the new passphrase twice, type quit  and type
yes to save changes.
