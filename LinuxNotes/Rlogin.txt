RLOGIN
------

Objective
---------
Setting up rlogin server and connecting to an rlogin
server.


Server
------
Start server:

	chkconfig rlogin on

It listens on port 513.


Client
------
To connect to rlogin server, assuming it is
192.168.0.1:

	rlogin -l bill 192.168.0.1

It prompts for login name and password just like telnet.	


Rlogin without passwords
------------------------
The rlogin, rsh and rcp commands have been disabled by default.
All require authentication via pam. The pam settings are in:

	/etc/pam.d

directory.

To enable rlogin without password, edit:

	/etc/pam.d/rlogin 

and set all as sufficient:

	
#%PAM-1.0
# For root login to succeed here with pam_securetty, "rlogin" must be
# listed in /etc/securetty.
auth       sufficient	/lib/security/pam_nologin.so
auth       sufficient	/lib/security/pam_securetty.so
auth       sufficient   /lib/security/pam_env.so
auth       sufficient	/lib/security/pam_rhosts_auth.so
auth       sufficient	/lib/security/pam_stack.so service=system-auth
account    sufficient	/lib/security/pam_stack.so service=system-auth
password   sufficient	/lib/security/pam_stack.so service=system-auth
session    sufficient	/lib/security/pam_stack.so service=system-auth


Make sure you save the original rlogin before making changes.

Then, start the rlogin server:

	chkconfig rlogin on


You can now login from client, without password:

	rlogin -l bill 192.168.0.1

No need to create .rhosts. Also no need to add the -h flag to 
/etc/xinet.d/rlogin startup script.  Because Linux uses pam 
authentication, .rhosts doesn't work. Tail /var/log/messages will tell
you that -h etc options has been relegated to pam_rhosts_auth in
/etc/pam.conf.  Although it says /etc/pam.conf, the man pam.d manual will tell
you that there is an option of using /etc/pam.conf or /etc/pam.d/.
RedHat 8 uses /etc/pam.d/


The same applies for rcp and rsh, edit the /etc/pam.d/rsh
and start the rsh service:

	chkconfig rsh on

Then, 	
	rsh -l bill 192.168.0.1 ls
