WEB SERVER
==========

Objective
---------
To start, stop and configure web server and cgi-script
capability.


Starting and Stopping Servers
-----------------------------
Servers are programs that run in the background and provide
services to client programs. The Web Server is called
httpd, also known as Apache. To start,

	/etc/rc.d/init.d/httpd start

To restart

	/etc/rc.d/init.d/httpd restart

To stop

	/etc/rc.d/init.d/httpd stop

To find out if it is running

	/etc/rc.d/init.d/httpd status

Or, more commonly,

	netstat -tan

You will see something like this:


Proto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address           Foreign Address         State      
tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:80              0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      
tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:23              0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      
tcp        0      0 192.168.1.173:1881      192.168.20.3:22         ESTABLISHED 


Notice the line with "0.0.0.0:80 ......        LISTEN"

This shows that the web server is up and running.



Web Server Configuration File
-----------------------------
The web server configuration file is:

	/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf

At this point, the only variable  you need to set is the 
ServerName directive.

Open the httpd.conf file with vi editor and look for the
variable "ServerName".  If your Server name is "Ronin"
set:

	ServerName Ronin

Note that the default is 

	ServerName localhost

which will produce an error when you try to start the server.
This servername should also match the name given in 

	/etc/hosts

eg, 
	
	127.0.0.1	Ronin localhost.localdomain localhost
	192.168.20.3	Ronin		
	192.168.1.3	intipen


and
	/etc/sysconfig/network

eg,

	NETWORKING=yes
	HOSTNAME=Ronin
	GATEWAY=192.168.1.1


Everytime you make any changes to httpd.conf, you will need to
restart the httpd server for the new configuration to take
effect.


Web Server Root Directory
-------------------------
The web server root directory is:

	/var/www/

All web pages should be placed in /var/www/html and all cgi
scripts should be placed in /var/www/cgi-bin

cgi scripts are programs. It may be written in shell, bash,
perl, PHP , C, etc.

You can run a program by entering the URL as follows:

	http://192.168.0.1/cgi-bin/hello.sh

assuming you have written a program called "hello.sh" and
put it in /var/www/cgi-bin, and your server's IP address is
192.168.0.1.

All html pages should be put in /var/www/html.  the default
web page is index.html.  If you entered an URL like this:

	 	
	http://192.168.0.1/cgi-bin/hello.sh


It will execute the "hello.sh" program.  An example of a 
hello.sh is:

	
	#!/bin/sh

	echo Content-type:text/html
	echo
	echo Hello World


The program merely echoes the message "Hello World" to the user's
web browser.


Web Server Directories for Users
-------------------------------------
Only root has write permission  to the root directory:

	/var/www

For ordinary users, they cannot write to the root directory.
However, you can enable them to use their home directories to 
house web pages and cgi-scripts. 

Edit this file 

	/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf

by enabling the directive "UserDir" as follows:

	UserDir public_html

Then restart the httpd server.  The system administrator then
needs to:

	
	chmod 711 /home/bill
	mkdir 	  /home/bill/public_html
	chmod 755 /home/bill/public_html

The user puts his "index.html" (the default page) into the
public_html directory and all other web pages as well


cgi-bin and php directories for Users
-------------------------------------
In order for non-root users to write and use their own
cgi scripts, we need to:

	download and install cgiwrap-3.7

The current version of CGIwrap is available from:

	http://cgiwrap.unixtools.org
	http://sourceforge.net/projects/cgiwrap

Alternatively, use www.google.com to search for the latest
web-site for cgiwrap.


What is CGIwrap?
-----------------

CGIWrap is a gateway that allows more secure user access to
CGI programs on the http server. The primary function of
CGIwrap is to make certain that any CGI script runs with 
the permissions of the user who installed it, and not those
of the server.

Use these commands:

	gunzip cgiwrap-3.7.tar.gz
	tar -xvf cgiwrap-3.7.tar

Then enter the cgiwrap-3.7 directory,

	cd cgiwrap-3.7



CGIWrap - Installation Instructions
-----------------------------------

Issue 
	./configure --help 

to find out the various configuration options. You will need
to specify some of them. At the very least, you will want to 
specify 

	./configure --with-httpd-user=apache

Note that the "User" directive is found in the 

	/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf

and is set as:

	User apache

Type
	make

If you specified the installation directory in the options, 
you can type

	make install

Once the executable "cgiwrap" has been compiled, copy it to your
servers cgi-bin directory

	/var/www/cgi-bin

Make "cgiwrap" owned by root, executable by all, and setuid.
(Note: This step must be performed while logged in as "root")

          chown root cgiwrap
          chmod 4755 cgiwrap

Symlink nph-cgiwrap, nph-cgiwrapd, cgiwrapd to cgiwrap in
the cgi-bin directory.

          ln -s cgiwrap cgiwrapd
          ln -s cgiwrap nph-cgiwrap
          ln -s cgiwrap nph-cgiwrapd




Then append to /httpd/conf/httpd.conf:

	RewriteEngine On
	RewriteRule ^/~(.*)/cgi-bin/(.*) /cgi-bin/cgiwrap/$1/$2 [PT]


Then restart:
	/etc/rc.d/init.d/httpd restart





Where to put html and scripts
------------------------------
Where to put your html pages and cgi scripts


Create these directories:

  /home/username/public_html
  /home/username/public_html/cgi-bin
  /home/username/public_html/php

Put index.html and all .html pages in public_html directory
Put shell and perl scripts in cgi-bin directory
Put php scripts in php directory


Remember to chmod 755 all your scripts to make them executable, eg

  chmod 755 hello.cgi


To access the cgi scripts, use the following URLs:

http://www.abc.com/~username/   [ default web page is index.html ]
http://www.abc.com/~username/cgi-bin/hello.cgi
http://www.abc.com/~username/php/hello.php




Redirects
---------
To redirect all requests to another web-site, insert this line
in /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf :

	<VirtualHost 219.93.225.219>
           ServerName hostel
	   Redirect /index.html http://iicpen.intipen.edumy/index.html
	</VirtualHost>

where 219.93.225.219 (which could be in name as well) is the IP (or name)
of the machine that apache runs on, and, "hostel" or FQDN (eg, www....),
is the name of the machine that apache runs on.
