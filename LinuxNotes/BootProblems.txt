BOOT PROBLEMS
=============

Objective
---------
Troubleshooting and solving some boot problems.



Unable to open initial console
------------------------------

Problem:
-------

When booting, you get the message:
Unable to open an initial console
Then the system freezes.



Cause:
------

This message appears exactly when your system tries to open /dev/tty1
and it is not there. The possible reasons for this are:

    * Lilo was not installed
    * Wrong root partition (LILO)
    * /dev/tty1 got erased
    * The kernel was compiled without support for virtual termainals.
    * if /dev/console is missing.

If you cant open /dev/console this is the exact erorr message.



Solution:
---------

1. Lilo was not installed

Perhaps you forgot, after recompiling your kernel, to run lilo. To repair this,
use the installation disks to boot to your installed system, and then run the command:

        /sbin/lilo

2. Wrong root partition (when using LILO):

If you boot with LILO, specify the correct root partition at the LILO prompt.
In our example this will be /dev/sdb1 :

        LILO: linux root=/dev/sdb1

You should then adapt /etc/lilo.conf (don't forget to call /sbin/lilo afterwards).


3. /dev/tty1 got erased :

Start the rescue system. Mount the root partition on /mnt and recreate the device:

        mknod -m600 /mnt/dev/tty1 c 4 1


4.  Boot up from a Linux boot/root disk combination. 
Mount the root filesystem (be it /dev/hda1, /dev/hdb1, etc.) 
somewhere using the command:

       mount /dev/whatever /mnt -t ext2

Then check /mnt/dev for the following:

console
tty1

They should look something like (with an ls -l)

crw-------   2 root     root   4, 0 Jan 7 14:58 /dev/console
crw-------   2 root     root   4, 1 Jan 7 14:58 /dev/tty1

(the permissions [crw, etc.], owner [root], and date/time don't matter. 
What matters is that they exist, and have those mystical number pairs.)

Do you have those? If not, try using mknod:

mknod /mnt/dev/console c 4 0
mknod /mnt/dev/tty1 c 4 1



 5.   Boot with a bootdisk and when you get to the spot for extra commands
 type: 
 
 	mount root=/dev/xxxx where xxxx is the linux partition.
	
	
 It sounds like lilo has the wrong partition listed for linux.
 Once you're in edit /etc/lilo.conf, fix the problem and re-install lilo.



Other possible reasons
----------------------

lilo.conf corrupted
/dev/console,  /dev/tty0  or  /dev/tty1 corrupted



Making Boot Disks
-----------------

To install linux where BIOS does not support CD-ROM
(eg, in very old PCs):

On another PC, insert Redhat install CD into CD-ROM, then:

	mount /mnt/cdrom

	cd /mnt/cdrom/Redhat/boot

Insert a 1.44 MB floppy then:

	dd if=boot.img of=/dev/fd0

You may need to do the same to copy the drivers to the
floppy.  

Insert the Redhat CD into the target PC then,
insert the floppy into the target PC, then go into CMOS to 
set it to boot from A:. Then follow the instructions. It may
ask you to insert a second floppy (containing the drivers).

Once your CD driver is loaded, you can continue installing from
the CD as usual.


Last Resort
-----------
Reinstall the OS, but before doing so,
remove the Hard disk and slot into another linux
box as a secondary master. It will be known as

	/dev/hdc

Note:
	/dev/hda    	primary master
	/dev/hdb	primary slave
	/dev/hdc	secondary master
	/dev/hdd   	secondary slave


Being /dev/hdc, it will probably have something like
this:

	/dev/hdc1	primary partition
	/dev/hdc4	extended partition

	/dev/hdc5	logical partitions
	/dev/hdc6
	/dev/hdc7

The second linux box's OS will be in /dev/hda.
Create the following in /mnt:

	mkdir h1 h4 h5 h6 h7

Then mount them:

	mount /dev/hdc1 h1
	mount /dev/hdc4 h4
	mount /dev/hdc5 h5
	mount /dev/hdc6 h6
	mount /dev/hdc7 h7

cd to each mounted partition and backup to a directory
in /dev/hda, probably:

	/tmp/Backup

Umount, poweroff and remove the second hard disk, and
insert it back onto it's original motherboard, then
reinstall the OS.

Using diskdruid, when it comes to selecting the partitions
to format, avoid those partitions containing data. Just install
the boot and system partitions.

The, reboot,  your original data is still intact.
