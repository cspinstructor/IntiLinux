VPN - POINT-TO-POINT TUNELLING PROTOCOL (PPTP)
-----------------------------------------------

Objective
---------
Installing and running pptpd (PPTP server).


What is PPTP?
------------
A Microsoft protocol for VPN - Virtual Private Networking.
A generic one is described in the Chapter VPN-PPPSH.txt


Where to get it
---------------
http://www.poptop.org

The tarball is:

	pptpd-1.1.4-b4.tar.gz

Download to:

	/usr/local/pptp


Installation
------------

	cd /usr/local/pptp

then,


	tar zxvf pptpd-1.1.4-b4.tar.gz

a new directory containing the installation scripts is created:

	poptop-1.1.4

	cd poptop-1.1.4

then,

	./configure
	make
	make install

To cleanup,

	make clean
	make distclean



Configuration
-------------
The config file is in:

	/usr/local/pptp/poptop-1.1.4/samples

Copy it to /etc:

	cp pptpd.conf     /etc
	cp options.pptpd  /etc/ppp
	

[pptpd.conf]


################################################################################
#
# Sample PoPToP configuration file
#
# for PoPToP version 1.1.4-b3
#
################################################################################

# TAG: speed
#
#	Specifies the speed for the PPP daemon to talk at.
#
#speed 115200

# TAG: option
#
#	Specifies the location of the PPP options file.
#	By default PPP looks in '/etc/ppp/options'
#
option /etc/ppp/options.pptpd

# TAG: stimeout
#
#	Specifies timeout (in seconds) on starting ctrl connection
#
# stimeout 10

# TAG: debug
#
#	Turns on (more) debugging to syslog
#
#debug

# TAG: bcrelay <if>
#
#	Turns on broadcast relay to clients from interface <if>
#
#bcrelay eth1

# TAG: localip
# TAG: remoteip
#
#	Specifies the local and remote IP address ranges.
#
#	You can specify single IP addresses seperated by commas or you can
#	specify ranges, or both. For example:
#
#		192.168.0.234,192.168.0.245-249,192.168.0.254
#
#	IMPORTANT RESTRICTIONS:
#
#	1. No spaces are permitted between commas or within addresses.
#
#	2. If you give more IP addresses than MAX_CONNECTIONS, it will
#	   start at the beginning of the list and go until it gets 
#	   MAX_CONNECTIONS IPs. Others will be ignored.
#
#	3. No shortcuts in ranges! ie. 234-8 does not mean 234 to 238,
#	   you must type 234-238 if you mean this.
#
#	4. If you give a single localIP, that's ok - all local IPs will
#	   be set to the given one. You MUST still give at least one remote
#	   IP for each simultaneous client.
#
localip 192.168.0.1
remoteip 192.168.0.2-254
#remoteip 192.168.0.234-238,192.168.0.245
# or
#localip 192.168.0.234-238,192.168.0.245
#remoteip 192.168.1.234-238,192.168.1.245

## CHANGE TO SUIT YOUR SYSTEM
lock

## turn pppd syslog debugging on
debug

## change 'pptpd' to whatever you specify as your server name in chap-secrets
name pptpd

proxyarp
bsdcomp 0

# This option applies if you use ppp with chapms-strip-domain patch
#chapms-strip-domain

# These options apply if you use ppp with mppe patch
# NB! You should also apply the ChapMS-V2 patch

#-chapms
#+chapms-v2
#mppe-128
#mppe-stateless

# These options will tell ppp to pass on these to your clients
# To use ms-wins or ms-dns in options.pptpd it must exist in /etc/resolv.conf
#ms-wins your.server.here
#ms-dns your.server.here

Starting the Server
-------------------

As root,

	pptpd

Checking,

	netstat -tan

will show tcp port 1723 listening

Checking logs,

	tail /var/log/messages

will show 
	pptpd : MGR : Manager process started
	pptpd : MGR : Maximum 100 connections available 

Help files
----------
To get help:

	man pptpd.conf
	man pptpd



Windows Client 
--------------
Click Dial up networking and click add new.
Select Microsoft VPN Adapter.
To connect, double click on the new Icon in Dial Up Networking.
Enter the username and password and click connect.


Linux Client
------------
Download pptp-linux-1.3.1-1.rpm from sourceforge via the link on:

	http://www.poptop.org

	rpm -Uvh pptp-linux-1.3.1-1.rpm

will say dependency fail because it needs:

	ppp => 2.4.2 is needed

but we on RedHat 8, our ppp is:


	pppd -V

	ppp v. 2.4.1

Therefore, download ppp-2.4.2 from:

	www.rpmfind.com

You will find that ppp-2.4.2 only exists for ASPLinux, but it's OK, we 
can use it for RedHat as well.

	
	rpm -Uvh ppp-2.4.2-0.20030618asp.i386.rpm


Then check again:

	pppd --version

	pppd version 2.4.2b3

Then, proceed to install pptp:

	rpm -Uvh pptp-linux-1.3.1-1.rpm


And this time, it installs successfully.

To connect,

	pptp <IP address>



Problems
--------
For some reason, PPTP doesn't work well.
I couldn't telnet, ssh, ftp, http across the tunnel.

But Windows clients can connect to Linux PPTP server, and that is
pretty much it, can't do anything really useful.

I haven't tried Linux PPTP client connecting to Win200 PPTP server.

Recommend using VPN-PPPSH, instead, which is much easier to setup
and more reliable.
