NETWORK MANAGEMENT
==================

Objective
---------
To familiarize oneself with common Network Management and Monitoring tools.
The commands below are ordered aphabetically.
This chapter describes some utility programs, not SNMP.
SNMP is described in the SNMP.txt chapter.



arp
---
To check for the MAC addresses of other hosts on the LAN:

	arp


or, to find out a specific IP's MAC address:

	arp -a 192.168.1.2



dig
---
To query a nameserver for resource records.

	dig mx www.hotmail.com

will give the email smtp server's name

	dig ns www.hotmail.com

will give hotmail's name server.



host
----
To find out the IP address of a name:

	host www.hotmail.com


lsof
---
To find out what program is using a particular port:

	lsof -i tcp:23

for tcp and port 23, or,

	lsof -i udp:517

to investigate udp port 517

lsof will display, among others, the PID of the process that is
using the port. You can then do a kill -9 on the PID.


An alternative is to use netstat as described below.


netstat 
-------

To find out what services are up and running:


[tcp]
	netstat -tan   

[udp]
	netstat -uan


[tcp with name of services]

	netstat -ta

[udp with name of services]

	netstat -ua

netstat is also used to see who is connected to the server.

To behave likd lsof, ie, find out the PID and program name that is 
using the portnumbers:

	netstat -tanp



nmap
----
To check which hosts are alive on the Network:

	nmap -sP 192.168.1.2-254 > nmap.txt


The -s is to specify scan type, -sP means ping sweep.


To check what ports are open on a machine:

	nmap -sS 192.168.1.2 > nmap.txt

-sS means scan type is stealth.

To scan a range of IP and the open ports for each IP:

	nmap -sS 192.168.1.2-100 > nmap.txt





To find out the OS of the machine:

	nmap -sS -O 192.168.1.2



To scan only for certain ports:


	nmap -sS -O 192.168.1.2 -p 1-139


or, simply:

	nmap 192.168.1.2 -p 1-139


ping
----
To check whether a particular host is alive and to confirm network
connectivity:

	ping 192.168.1.2



tcpdump
-------
You must be root to run tcpdump.
To check whether anyone is using the LAN on a particular interface, 
eth0:

	tcpdump -i eth0


The output may be too fast to read. To limit to 3 packets:

	tcpdump -c 3 -i eth0

To filter only port 80 packets:

	
	tcpdump -c 3 -i eth0 port 80


To dump the bytes and decode to ASCII:

	tcpdump -c 1  -X -i eth0 port 23

The above will dump 1 packet of interface eth0 filtered based on port 23.
It will dump the hex and decode them to ASCII as well.


w or who
-------
To find out who is logged in:

	who

or
	w


whois
-----
To find which ISP owns a particular IP address:

	whois -h whois.arin.net <IP address>
	whois -h whois.apnic.net <IP address>
	whois -h whois.ripe.net <IP address>


arin is for US, apnic for Asia and ripe is for Europe.
