MODEMS
======

Objective
---------
To setup an analog telephone modem and configure it to dial up
an Internet Service Provider 


Installing a modem
-------------------
First check to see which serial device is installed:

At the shell type:

	setserial -g /dev/ttyS* | less

or
	setserial -a /dev/ttyS* | less

for more verbose output.

There will be a long list of devices ttyS0 - ttyS9, but
the top two might be:

	/dev/ttyS0, UART: 16550A, Port: 0x03f8, IRQ: 4
	/dev/ttyS1, UART: 16550A, Port: 0x02f8, IRQ: 3

How do we know which one is the modem? Type this:

	ls -l /dev/modem*

If you get:

	lrwxrwxrwx ............ /dev/modem1 -> /dev/ttyS0

then you know that the modem is :

	/dev/ttyS0


Alternatively, you could check /etc/sysconfig/hwconf and see
something like this among other things:

	
	class: MOUSE
	bus: SERIAL
	detached: 0
	device: ttyS0
	driver: generic
	desc: "Generic Serial Mouse"
	-
	class: MODEM
	bus: SERIAL
	detached: 0
	device: ttyS1
	driver: ignore
	desc: "Generic Serial Modem"




If Modem not installed
-----------------------

If modem is not installed, then plugin your modem, and
install it on /dev/ttyS1 if your mouse is installed 
on /dev/ttyS0. To install, do this:

	ln -s /dev/ttyS1 /dev/modem

This establishes a softlink between /dev/modem and the
serial device /dev/ttyS1.

To test if it is correctly installed, use minicom program
to dial a number:

	minicom

Once it starts, type:

	ATDT 1511

Or, any other telephone number.  


Setting up Internet dialup account
----------------------------------
Once the modem is installed, setup the Internet 
account by modifying the configuration file:

	/etc/wvdial.conf

as follows:


	[Dialer Defaults]
	Modem = /dev/ttyS1
	Baud = 57600
	Init1 = ATZ
	SetVolume = 0
	Dial Command = ATDT

	[Dialer Jaring]
	Username = billgates 
	Password = mikersof
	Phone = 1511
	Inherits = Dialer Defaults
	Stupid mode = 0

	[Dialer Tmnet]
	Username = steve 
	Password = zapple
	Phone = 1515
	Inherits = Dialer Defaults
	Stupid mode = 0

To dial to Jaring, as root, type:

	wvdial Jaring

To dial Tmnet, as root, type:

	wvdial Tmnet

The program wvdial will look for a matching record in wvdial.conf
and execute the parameters therein.

Another easier way is to run this command;

	wvdialconf /etc/wvdial.conf

This program will autosearch for any installed/connected modem
and generate a configuration file in /etc/wvdial.conf. You then
edit this file to insert the Username, Password and phone.


ISDN Modem
----------
For ISDN Terminal Adapter Modems, it behaves just like a normal
telephone analog modem. Use wvdialconf, then for the stupid mode,
set it to 1:

	Stupid mode = 1

The default is 0, which means, after Carrier is detected and the
1512 number is dialled, it waits for the ISP to send a prompt.
For ISDN services, there is no prompt, and the dialer should not 
wait, hence setting stupid mode to 1.
