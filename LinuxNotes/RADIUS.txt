RADIUS  (Remote Authentication Dial In User Service)
====================================================

Objective
---------
[1] Installing and running Cistron RADIUS server.
[2] Installing and running NAS.




What is it?
-----------
RADIUS  stands for Remote Authentication Dial In User Service.
and was invented by Lucent Internetworking and is officially known
as the Internet standard RFC2865.

Cistron Radius is an Open Source implementation.
Basically it is an authentication and accounting server that speaks the 
RADIUS protocol. 

Commonly used by ISP's to authenticate user dial up internet service.

Development has since moved to the FreeRADIUS server, but Cistron RADIUS
presently continues to have a wide user base.



Architecture
-------------
In an ISP Setting, the Internet User dials the Network Access Server ("NAS")
modem, the NAS answers and obtains the login and password and connects to
RADIUS Server for Authentication and Accounting.  The architecture is as shown
in Fig A. below.

				       
     Internet User                  
 	  modem  <----->   modem                     
			 NAS Server <------> RADIUS 
			     ^               Server
			     |
			     |
			     V	
			  Routers <-----> Internet

	    -------------------------

The NAS contacts the server each time the User connects or disconnects so that
the RADIUS server can keep proper Accounts.

We are going to install Cistron Radius and Portslave on the same machine.
Portslave is one of the Radius Clients and is an example of NAS.
It is also known as a terminal server that does PPP and authenticates
via RADIUS.


[ CISTRON RADIUS INSTALLATION ]

Where to get it
---------------
Download:

	radiusd-cistron-1.6.6.tar.gz

from

	http://www.radius.cistron.nl/

Copy it to /usr/local/radius, unpack the tarball:

	tar zxvf radiusd-cistron-1.6.6.tar.gz

Enter the new directory:

	cd radiusd-cistron-1.6.6

Read the INSTALL file.  Basically it says to enter the
src directory and copy the Makefile.lnx (for Linux) to Makefile.
However, no need to do that, because a diff showed that 
Makefile is set default for Linux. So, enter the src directory,

	cd src

And just run make:

	make

The binaries will be compiled, then install:

	make install



Configuration
-------------
Enter the redhat directory, you will find:

	rc.radiusd-redhat

copy it to /etc/rc.d/init.d as rc.radiusd.init:

	cp rc.radiusd-redhat /etc/rc.d/init.d/radiusd.init


You need to change the following two lines in the radiusd.init script:

	RADIUSD=/usr/sbin/radiusd
	RADRELAY=/usr/sbin/radrelay

to

	RADIUSD=/usr/local/sbin/radiusd
	RADRELAY=/usr/local/sbin/radrelay

Confirm first with whereis:

	whereis radiusd
	whereis radrelay



Help
----
The man pages are in:

	man 8 radiusd




Starting the RADIUS daemon
--------------------------

To start radiusd:

	/etc/init.d/radiusd start

To stop:

	/etc/init.d/radiusd stop

Do a netstat :

	netstat -uan

You will notice that it listens on 2 udp ports:

	udp	1812 
	udp 	1813


To confirm that they are radius, 

	lsof -i udp:1812
	lsof -i udp:1813

	1812  -- radius
	1813  -- radius-acct


Port 1812 is the main radius port whilst 1813 is for Accounting.


Monitoring
----------
radwho will show who is logged in.

Others:

last -f /var/log/radutmp
last -f /var/log/radius.log



[PORTSLAVE INSTALLATION]

Where to get it?
----------------

Download portslave-2002.10.21.tar.gz  via 
http://www.tuxfinder.com


Installation
------------
tar zxvf portslave...

cd portslave...

./configure



Note
----
I have managed to get the Cistron RADIUS working but unable to field test
it yet since i have not completed the Portslave Installation.
